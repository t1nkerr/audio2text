Andrew Polk:
I was thinking about how for several years now, we have really talked about the lack of consumer confidence, weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market, and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to lead people onto a better path. And our thesis was that the government would have to do it. It would have to do it at the Third Plenum, which happened last year, or they would do it at the two sessions. It kept feeling like the government was missing these opportunities, but then here the private sector, the deep seek thing, comes, and maybe it seems like, we will wait to see, it has only been a month and a half or so, but maybe that was the catalyst that they needed. And I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, from that deep seek development, like you said, how important AI is, and how we now have a path towards putting it into government policy, supporting it at the government policy. And we now see a path for, we recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. And so it turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the purview or even expectation of the Chinese government, and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, and not to overuse that. But I do think, if you remember last year, things were great in Q1, and I think things started to go bad in Q2. I do want to say there are a few things here. Second, it depends on whether Trump decides to tighten the screw in China again, significantly increase tariffs. I think that does have a significant impact. And I think more importantly is if that happens, we or the policymakers do as they say, which is deploy additional policy supporting in a very timely manner, because if that happens again, I can see this fragile confidence building up, going to go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, 100%. It is not the slam dunk that we are now on a new path. Well, this is our business. We watch this stuff closely, and we try to see if we are on a new trajectory. But speaking of that, that is actually a perfect pivot point, speaking of Trump and potentially Xi, this constant will they or won't they reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet. And again, I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast is to try to think about China's perspective on things. And here, and not make it all about US-China, but with the CDF and this context this week, I think this is particularly relevant. Diving into the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. And so just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC, and they were expressing to me a point that I thought made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we were talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea. But just so you know, our normal operating procedure is to have working level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth, then we kick that up to the next level, after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out to the next higher level, maybe it is the ministerial, you know, cabinet level. Those people work out. Then we go up to the next level, which might be the senior leaders, the heads of state. They meet, it is pretty much just pro forma. They are just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That is how we like to operate, right? And I was like, well, those working level meetings do not seem like they are happening. They are like, no, they are not happening. But obviously, Donald Trump, and so first of all those working level meetings, like I said, are not happening. I think maybe not obviously. But Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the head of state and basically have one on one with Xi Jinping, sort things out and then go top down instead of bottom up. Have everybody below them then work out the details of how to get things done. So I guess let me bring in Joe again here and then we will bring you in again, Ether. Do you think that is the right read on the situation, Joe? And secondly, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that absolutely tracks. As I mean, I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol conscious no matter where they are from and I think that is especially true in the Chinese system where just the political, politics is very choreographed in most respects. And beyond just the simple questions of protocol. I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time, obviously in US-China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. So, you know, we are talking about optics, right? There was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that is the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You are going to not only Trump's home turf in terms of being in the states, but his literal home turf. There were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because that a lot more of the protocol is then in their hands, and they play the gracious host. And there have been a number of other suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I am now of the opinion, I do not think one is imminent. It does not mean one will not happen, but I think that the Chinese side as you mentioned is very nervous about I suppose the very ad hoc way that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. And that sort of brings me to the second point, which is outcomes, right? So beyond the optics of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that he was not aware of or did not agree to or anything like that. There is a lot riding on this meeting, right? I mean, Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Bessent to the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the phase one trade deal from way back in 2020. So, I mean, if it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US-China trade and economic tension, right? Equally, if it goes badly, I mean, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work and if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think grow increasingly dim and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain or at least agreeing to work towards something that will help to satisfy both sides, that that reduces dramatically, right? And the fact that working level groups have apparently stalled out, mean that it is going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it is really important that both sides get this right and if they do not, I mean, I think it could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side does not want to see and ultimately would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, I totally agree with you both. I think I just want to try and think through because, you know, our job is trying to be forward looking. As you kind of talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. And I think what could happen is actually, Andrew, you kind of mentioned that Trump prefers a top-down approach and for the Chinese, they prefer a bottom-up. And I think the possible way out is probably to start from someone at the middle level, which is, you know, both leaders appoint a deputy who is in charge of this and they can hash things out. And if we look back to Trump 1.0, it is basically Leihiser hashed out a deal with Liu He, right? So far, we have not seen that level, very productive engagement at that level. I think Vice Premier Liu He had one call with the counterpart in the states side, but not much engagement so far. But I think it still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that process. It is basically they hop up on the call saying, hey, you know, this deal is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it. I think if one thing.

Andrew Polk:
Can I ask you if you can…

Ether Yin:
Yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Polk:
I was just going to ask you, so, I mean, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ether Yin:
Liu He.

Andrew Polk:
I am struggling on the US side to think who it would be. Partly because I just like I said, I think Donald Trump wants to take the lead and is not quite inclined to back any of his cabinet secretaries to necessarily believe that I basically do not think he trusts them to take that over. This is just my reading of it so far. Obviously, Daines, the Senator that we talked about from Montana is trying to sort of make a play to become an envoy. So I mean, I will just leave that US side aside for now, because it is not quite clear to me who that would be. But my question for you is who do you think it would be on the Chinese side?

Ether Yin:
It will be Vice Premier Liu He. He has a portfolio. US-China commercial relation is under him, and also he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. So he is a perfect person. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Great.

Ether Yin:
And he is a very savvy operative, very good at enforcing whatever Xi Jinping wants.

Andrew Polk:
And so he is in lock step with Xi and knows to speak for Xi.

Ether Yin:
Yes.

Andrew Polk:
Yes. And I think that is the challenge on the US side is like it is not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump.

Andrew Polk:
Okay, so that has been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider Geo.
