Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So, just for all those reasons, it's an event not to be missed and it's really drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs and different industries from high-profile companies.

It's also a chance to show that, we're in China for China, and they kind of express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that's come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like, China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions, to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this, and just of Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general.

There's also a piece, which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments, to say, "Hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving, and it's worth expanding." So that's another note that the Chinese side is hit on pretty frequently in recent years, and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question. You know, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence U.S. government decisions, at least for, I mean, decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working? Or is business heard from your perspective in, I mean, other capitals as well, but D.C. and Brussels in particular, is it or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a strong of a voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a brave new world, especially in the context of the U.S. and the Trump administration. I mean, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, "You know, hey, think about it, you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market, and there are still more to come." So it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of U.S.-China policy and China's relationship with other countries.

So now I think, you know, we talk about U.S.-China versus EU-China, those are sort of two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative. Sort of in the lead-up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on tariffs on Chinese EVs back in, I think it was November, there was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to kind of win over votes to their side on that. And ultimately those tariffs did go through. But I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this sort of wheeling and dealing.

For the U.S. side, I think that really remains to be seen. I mean, my immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual U.S. company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and sort of this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But I mean, certainly it doesn't hurt to try, and who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the Trump administration, sort of maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminous goals with China. Well then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the U.S. to sort of at least consider what its policy means for U.S. companies in China.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's a

Ether Yin:
Go ahead, Ethan.

Andrew Polk:
I think that's actually a very interesting question. And actually I want to kind of ask you guys about, I think in particular, Andrew, you because, you know, most of the time you're based in D.C., so you are very familiar with kind of the atmosphere there and how things are in D.C. My question is generally, do you think that compared kind of Trump and Biden on the Trump administration, there's kind of more room for U.S. business to influence policy a little bit? My assumption would be, my understanding with Biden because his administration operated on certain kind of principles and kind of, you know, red lines, you know. And basically when U.S. businesses have conversation trying to influence certain policies, and when kind of reach to, okay, this is kind of a national security matter for U.S. government, then that's the end of the conversation. There's no room for U.S. business to continue kind of influence. But with Trump, it's more like there's basically no principles or not kind of many kind of red lines, if there're kind of more room for U.S. business to influence his policies.

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking, as I often say, because I mean this is great because you guys are in China thinking about, you know, what's what the U.S. side is doing. We do obviously, as I say to our listeners, I always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to of course what's happening at the CDF.

I mean, my view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that basically that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration, in the first Trump administration, Trump administration officials saying basically, your companies are part of the problem. You have to create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there, and you're part of the problem, and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done. And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way you're part of the problem, but was also kind of maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons that you said, which was, the Biden administration just said, "Well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them."

Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses or a lot of U.S. businesses trying to get on Trump, on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all this other stuff, the tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, giving, you know, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration, generally, and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin:
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's good to know. That's good to know, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Do you have another question? Who's going to throw one back at you?

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually kind of, I mean, understanding that actually kind of helps kind of reinforce kind of our understanding about just basically whether Premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to kind of resist kind of the protectionism or these things kind of gonna work. I think it won't. I think that's kind of the bottom line. Just because, you know, for multinational companies they're facing increasing kind of pressure either from their home country government or even from public, right? So because to a certain extent, you know, they kind of like, you know, bring kind of jobs back, bring production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing.

And the other thing on the message is, you know, the Premier wanted to send at CDF is really kind of the master plan. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, you know, government has the backup economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when, you know, the government announced very aggressive or expensive kind of, you know, fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcast. I think the other kind of key message the Premier really trying to bring home at CDF is that, you know, everyone knows kind of things can get worse later this year if say, you know, Trump kind of very dramatically increased tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly.

So one key message that Li Qiang trying to say is that, we also, the policy makers also thought about that, and we already have a plan. And this time we will be kind of better prepared. And before that even happens, we will release additional policies, policies not included at the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to set that message loud and clear just to assure, you know, if you are worried about the China's economy, you know, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like, we're willing to stimulate more.
