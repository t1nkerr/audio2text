Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Seneca Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai, and I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. Feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. And then we're also glad to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. A long time listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst and Ether being our overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. We'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see. The weather's very nice. But also, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes, I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. We keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. Let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think life is great. Almost half my life is work, which is this company. I think we're doing great. Also, having you guys coming to Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain about. How's the general vibe in regard to the China business environment? I think that gets interesting because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, if we're talking about Chinese private business, I think the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. If we can talk about why, what happened, later. But if we're talking about foreign business, it's probably on a different track. There are some improvements for them, probably on the domestic front, but also in general, external challenges they are facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. On a net, I don't know where that puts them. In general, compared to Chinese private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, we'll get into why that is. Why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems is kind of what I say, small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face-to-face with our colleagues and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Before we get into the main discussion, go through a couple quick housekeeping notes as usual.

All right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days. So we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So, it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, talking about the economy. He's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year, they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to the meeting with the premier. The meeting with the premier is usually kind of the highlight for these executives. Yeah, kind of giving that background. Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I just want to point out. If you look at the premier's meetings with business, I could argue for some foreign business still kind of disappointing because the whole setting is primarily focused on US business. And the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So, you can still argue that meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. The geopolitics obviously in the US-China relationship specifically hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's, Joe, is he from your home state, Montana?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead, but it's all about the US business community. And the European business community, and the Asian community are like, how do we fit in? It just underscores the point that geopolitics hang heavy over everything. Let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, from his senior government officials on the Chinese side, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Well, I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, the CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also a chance opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So, just for all those reasons, it's an event not to be missed and really have drawn pretty wide a selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. Um, it's also a chance to show that we're in China for China and they express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that's come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. These are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and just about Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overtures the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism. So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. So that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
You hit the points well. I guess one follow-up question, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions at least for decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular, or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a stronger voice among politicians?

Joe Mazur:
It's a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. It doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, think about it. You've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries. We talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are two different things. What we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative, in the lead-up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in November, there was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to win over votes to their side on that. Ultimately, those tariffs did go through, but it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. My immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. It certainly doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? Maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO, like Tim Cook, lobbying the the Trump administration, maybe not on behalf of China, but with coterminous goals with China, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah.

Ether Yin:
That's a

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I think that's actually a very interesting question and I want to ask you guys, in particular Andrew, you, because most of the time you're based in DC. So you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, there's more room for US business to influence the policy a little bit. My assumption would be my understanding with Biden, because his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. Basically, when US business have a conversation trying to influence certain policies, and when reach to, this is a national security matter for US government, then that's the end of conversation. There's no room for US business to continue influence. But with Trump, it's more like there's basically no principles or not many red lines. If there are more room for US business to influence his policies.

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting, happy to walk through my thinking. This is great because you guys are in China thinking about what the US side is doing. We do obviously, as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to of course what's happening at the CDF. My view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration officials saying, basically your companies are part of the problem. You helped create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done. That mentality was not said the exact same way, you're part of the problem, but was also maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons that you said, which was the Biden administration just said, well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them. Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses or a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all these other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, giving, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration generally and potentially when it comes to China. Basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin:
Right. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's good to know.

Andrew Polk:
Do you have another question? I was going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually, understanding that actually helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether the premier Li Qiang's call for foreign business to resist the protectionism, all these things going to work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because for multinational companies, they're facing increasing pressure either from their home country government or even from public, right? Because to certain extent, bring jobs back, bring production back to the country is what the public wants as well. That's one thing. The other thing I want to on the message is, the premier wanted to send at CDF is really the domestic front. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, government has the back of the economy. We already saw that during two sessions in March when the government announced very aggressive or expensive fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcast. The other key message the premier really trying to bring home at the CDF is that everyone knows things can get worse later this year if say, Trump very dramatically increased tariffs on China. Things can go bad very quickly. So one key message that Li Qiang trying to send is that we also, the policy makers also thought about that and we already have a plan. And this time we'll be better prepared. And before that even happens, we will release additional policies. i.e. policies not included at the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to send that message loud and clear just to assure, if you are worried about the China's economy, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
So they're trying to say basically like, we're willing to stimulate more, we've got a bunch of tools in our toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And oh, by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape and we're going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. If we look at all the Chambers of Commerce survey, foreign Chambers of Commerce survey, last year, they're basically across Chamber of Commerce. The top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this geopolitical tension. Especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. The second one is geopolitical tension. I think that the order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most multinational companies, geopolitical top one concern. But economy, I think is still one of the second concerns. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of senior business executives, some of our clients. And the mood was actually, despite the economy being pretty bad, the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024. I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So they were COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then 2023, people were sort of sending lower level executives through trying to get their feet back into the China market. And then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024 and there was a lot of positive energy around these business people finally being back in China. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign. You've touched on it a little bit. But and then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying like, we've got the economy's back. We know the issues. But does anybody believe it? Where are businesses heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. In terms of the business vibes. For Chinese business, and even I sense that among the public a little bit is actually right after Chinese New Year, the sentiment getting to start to improve or getting warmed up.

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025. So February 25.

Ether Yin:
Yes. And the biggest thing happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year, if you all remember, the DeepSeek overnight become a headline globally, tanked the US stock market, even temporarily, but still basically made headlines all over the world. What that does to the both public sentiment and a business sentiment, I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular is that basically over the past few years, you're under this narrative or sense that we, by we, I mean, China's economy or Chinese industry is being suppressed by the US, either both government, sanctions and also US business. But just because of DeepSeek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue that if that's true or not and to what extent that's true. But still, that gave the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, manufacturing, everyone want to figure out, in their business, how they can integrate into this AI thing. And visibly in premier's government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of DeepSeek, they even changed some language in the government work report because some of the AI initiative wouldn't be possible without DeepSeek's overnight success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to global investors' revaluation of China's stock market and the price going up, a lot of folks here has investment in that, that also helps to boost sentiment. Then that lead to March two sessions, I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which is basically to the public and the industry here that, okay, government will keep their promise that the policy, economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So I think that changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I want to bring Joe in here because the reason I say that's huge is so I just said I was in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was optimism just because it was the first time these executives had been in China. They felt like they were re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled and over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024. I was in China at, during both of those periods, and it became evident at that point, like sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses and domestic individuals was, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing market still under wraps, people don't want to spend money, just like, things are not good. Hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months, that's really started to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've been in China for what, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in in sentiment as well, just among yourself as a consumer in China, your network of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that?

Joe Mazur:
Well, so I mean, first of all, I think it's an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I feel like in some ways, the fact that you can come here with between a gap of several months, you can in some ways are better positioned to say like, oh, this is different than the last time I was here. Whereas me, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot as you don't realize the change until until all of a sudden you do. Having said that, I tend to agree with Ether, just on the anecdotal level, last year it was my friends in Beijing, it was doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people who were saying to me, well, my parents pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in terms of price and I feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see fewer closed storefronts, which I think is been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well. And I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather is starting to get nice, maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, I think that there have been a number of developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about DeepSeek, but I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China maybe feel like they're not so not so bad off. They're certainly reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even something like the Xiaohongshu phenomenon, where it was the first time in possibly ever where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans interacting with each other on a large scale. I think, whether or not they gained a fully accurate picture of one another, I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China and there's a lot of aspects of the US which are quite troubling. Again, we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given the different ways that the information ecosystems are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. I wouldn't say it's like a massive night and day shift, but it's certainly just as a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as an economic indicator, it does seem somewhat better than it's been in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. Joe made a great point. The other aspect here or contributing factor here is that actually the Chinese are overprepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone is expecting the second term will be very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still not great, but still better than expected. Also on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China because seems like the US government is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like it's US against the world, everyone suffers. It's not just us. That also helps you improve how you feel a little bit.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's really interesting because just as you guys

Andrew Polk:
we're talking, both of you. I was thinking about how, for several years now, we've really talked about the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market, and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to sort of joint people onto a better path. Our thesis was like, well, the government will have to do it. It'll have to do it at the third plenum, which happened last year. They do it at the two sessions. And it kept feeling like the government was missing these opportunities, but then here, the private sector, the deep fake thing comes and maybe it seems like, we'll wait to see, it's only been a month and a half or so. But maybe that was the catalyst that they needed, and then I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, you know what, from that deep fake development, how important AI is and how we now have a path towards putting it into government policy, supporting it in government policy. And we see now a path for we see recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. It turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the purview or really the expectation of the Chinese government and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ether Yin:
Yeah. And not to over use it. But I do think, if you remember last year, things are great in Q1, and I think the thing has started to go bad in Q2. I do want to say there's a few things here. Second, it depends on whether Trump decided to tighten the screw in China again, significantly increase tariffs. I think that does have significant impact of that. More importantly is, if that happens, will the policy makers do as they say, which is deploy additional policy support in a very timely manner. Because if that happens again, I can see this fragile confidence building up, going to go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so 100%. It is not a slam dunk that we are now on a new path. This is our business. We watch this stuff closely, if we try to see if we are on the new trajectory. Speaking of, that's a great, actually, perfect pivot point. Speaking of Trump and potentially new tariffs, this constant will they, won't they reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet and again, I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast is to try to think about China's perspective on things and here and not make it all about US-China, but with the CDF and this context this week, I think this is particularly relevant. Diving into, the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC, and they were expressing to me a point that I thought was made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we were talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea. But, just so you know, our normal operating procedure is to have working level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth, then we kick that up to the next level after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out to the next higher level, maybe it's the ministerial, cabinet level, those people work out, then we go up to the next level, which might be the senior leaders, the heads of state, they meet, it's pretty much just pro forma, they're just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That's how we like to operate, right? I was like, well, those working level meetings don't seem like they're happening. They're like, no, they're not happening. Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the head of state and basically have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, sort things out and then go top down instead of bottom up, have everybody below them, then work out the details of how to get things done. Let me bring in Joe again here and then we'll bring you in again, Ether. Do you think that's the right read on the situation, Joe? Secondly, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I think that absolutely tracks. I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol conscious no matter where they're from, and I think that's especially true in the Chinese system, where just the political, politics is very choreographed in most respects. Beyond just the simple questions of protocol. I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time, obviously, in US-China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. We're talking about optics. There was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump, and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that's the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You're going to not only Trump's home turf in terms of being in the states, but his literal home turf. There were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because that a lot more of the protocol is then in their hands, and play the gracious host. There have been another number of other suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I'm now of the opinion, I don't think one is imminent. It doesn't mean one won't happen, but I think that the Chinese side, as you mentioned, is very nervous about the very ad hoc way that that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. That sort of brings me to the second point, which is outcomes. Beyond the optics of of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that he was not aware of or didn't agree to or anything like that. There's a lot riding on this meeting. Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Bessent, who the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the Phase One trade deal from way back in 2020. If it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US-China trade and economic tension. Equally, if it goes badly, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work. And if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think grow increasingly dim and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain or at least agreeing to work towards something that'll help to satisfy both sides, that reduces dramatically. The fact that working level group have apparently stalled out, mean that it's going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it's really important that both sides get this right. And if they don't, I think there could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side doesn't want to see and ultimately would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ether Yin:
Totally agree with you both. I just want to try and think through because our job is trying to be forward looking. As you talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. What could happen is actually, Andrew, you mentioned that Trump prefer top down approach and for the Chinese, they prefer bottom up. The possible way out is probably start from someone at middle level, which is both leaders appoint a deputy who is in charge of this and they can hash things out. If we look at back to Trump 1.0, it's basically Lighthizer hashed out a deal with a, right? So far, we haven't seen that level very productive engagement at that level. Vice Premier He Lifeng had one call with the counterpart in the stateside, but not much engagement so far. It still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that process. It's basically they hop on the call saying, hey, this deal is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it.

Andrew Polk:
Can I ask you? Go ahead. I was just going to ask you, so, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ether Yin:
He Lifeng.

Andrew Polk:
I'm struggling on the US side to think who it would be, partly because
