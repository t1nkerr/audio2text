[00:00:11] Andrew Polk: Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica podcast network. I'm your host, Trivium co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Washington, D.C., and I am once again joined by my Trivium co-founder, Trey McArver. Trey, great to have you on the podcast again as always. How are you doing? Are you ready to talk tariffs again?
[00:00:31] Trey McArver: Can't wait. So excited. Love tariffs. Can we just talk about tariffs forever?
[00:00:38] Andrew Polk: Well, yeah, actually, we probably will do. For listeners, we had quite a lively discussion before we started recording, so we're hoping to bring some of that energy to this podcast. There's obviously only one thing to talk about. There's only one thing that matters right now. That's the ever-escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, which kicked into even higher gear this week. So today we're going to discuss China's latest retaliation, both to Liberation Day tariffs last week and the most recent addition of 50% tariffs on U.S. imports from China this week. So China just retaliated to the retaliation, dropping an additional 50% tariffs on the U.S. imports into China as well. So we'll talk about that. We'll talk about where we stand now, what the outlook is from here in terms of a potential ongoing escalatory spiral or if there's any potential to de-escalate at some point. We'll talk about whether this was the right move for China to be the first in line to retaliate against U.S. tariffs. And here we have to say we kind of got this wrong last week. We recorded just a few hours before the Liberation Day announcement from Donald Trump, and our thinking at that time was maybe China would give it a little bit of time, a few days, maybe see how the dust settled, see what the EU is going to do, all that stuff. But no, China retaliated pretty much within 48 hours, not pretty much, within 48 hours on Friday morning in the U.S. So we'll kind of talk through all that stuff. And then we'll touch on what China can do to support its domestic economy to potentially offset the negative economic consequences that these huge new tariffs from Donald Trump will have. But first, we have to start with the vibe check. I think we've already kind of gotten one, but Trey, what's your vibe like right now?
[00:02:15] Trey McArver: I don't even know how to answer that question. I think my vibe will become obvious as we talk through the just absolute dumpster fire that is the global economy and bilateral relations.
[00:02:26] Andrew Polk: Yeah, my vibe is uncertain. I mean, I don't know where all this is going to go. Everyone I talk to is just hopeful it resolves quickly. My sense is it will not resolve quickly, not just the U.S.-China piece, but the U.S.-global piece that we're in for some volatility. I do worry, as you say, about potential U.S. recession, potential global recession. I mean, we're trying to run a business here. That's going to hurt our business, so we're concerned about that. I mean, it is one of those where the economic outcome seems patently obvious, and I just hope I'm wrong, you know?
[00:02:59] Trey McArver: Yes, I do. I know exactly what you mean.
[00:03:03] Andrew Polk: So, we'll see. But before we get into the meat of the discussion, as always, a couple quick housekeeping notes. As always, a reminder, we are not just a podcast.

Alright, with that, let's get into it. Here's the recap, Trey. So, I don't even think people need a recap, but we'll do it just in case there's like one person out there.
[00:04:12] Trey McArver: Also, I mean, is there any point in a recap when probably within 30 minutes there'll just be something else that has happened?
[00:04:19] Andrew Polk: Well, that's podcasting life, man.
[00:04:21] Trey McArver: Yeah. Maybe just to like kind of timestamp this discussion for all the listeners so they know where we are.
[00:04:27] Andrew Polk: We are at 11:23 a.m. on April 9th. That's a Wednesday. So, if anything we say is outdated by the time you listen to it, that's not our fault. So here's the recap from last week as to where we are at this moment. So, as everyone knows, last week, Trump announced his Liberation Day tariff, which took place just a few hours after we recorded our last pod, as I said. Trump hit China by far the hardest with 34% tariffs overall, and those came on top of 20% tariffs already levied on Chinese imports into the U.S. in February and March. That brought tariffs implemented on China to in 2025 to 54%, and in some cases, those are on top of previously existing tariffs, so the average tariff rate on Chinese goods was near 70% as of last Friday. China took less than 48 hours to respond, and early on Friday morning in the U.S., China announced 34% across-the-board tariffs on all imports coming from the U.S. They announced new export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements. They added 16 U.S. companies to China's control list for dual-use exports, and they added 11 U.S. firms to the unreliable entities list, which restricts, you know, investment and commerce in the Chinese market. They launched an anti-monopoly investigation into U.S. biotech giant DuPont. They launched an anti-dumping probe into imports of certain medical C.T. tubes from the U.S., and they banned sorghum from agricultural exporter C.D. USA Inc. along with import restrictions targeting two poultry exporters and a bone meal exporter effective immediately. So that was all as of last Friday. Then over the weekend, Donald Trump and early this week, I guess Donald Trump took exception to the retaliation, having said that if anybody retaliates to the Liberation Day tariffs, he will raise tariffs. So, he added an additional 50% tariffs on all goods coming from China as of basically today or or midnight this morning. And that brought the tariff rate on China's imports well over 100%, in some cases, up to 120%. And indeed, between the 104% tariffs added since January 20th, the ones from the previous two administrations, many P.R.C. goods, as I said, are now taxed somewhere around the 120% rate. So, late on Tuesday night, the White House also issued an executive order implementing de minimis tariff increase from 30% to 90%. So this is, like, you see China's having this multifaceted approach. Donald Trump now having an increasingly multifaceted approach. We're now in the stratosphere in terms of how high these tariffs are. Of course, this morning, on Wednesday, China retaliates to the retaliation, on the retaliation, announcing its own 50% tariffs. China's Ministry of Commerce also added a further 12 companies onto China's export control list, and MOFCOM added an additional six companies onto the unreliable entities list. So, actually, that retaliation of the day is somewhat, it's at least a shorter list of items than was on Friday, right? So they did retaliate, but we'll get into kind of how we view all of this. Trey, so, you know, head spinning back and forth. First question is, what do you make of this most recent response from the Chinese? So, what do you think of the move today as compared to Friday, last Friday? And where are we? I mean, are we in kind of uncontrollable escalatory territory or is there a chance to de-escalate? Take the first one on what you think about this move, and then we'll get into the escalation de-escalation.
[00:08:06] Trey McArver: Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, as you already pointed out, I'm not sure anybody should be asking us what's going to happen because when we talked a week ago, you know, we were sitting around talking about how China was going to slow-play this, sit back, absorb it, see what everybody else did, and then obviously, they hit back immediately. Given that, and given the way that Trump then kind of hit back, and China hit back again, now it does feel like we're kind of in an escalatory spiral. And we may really be in one as well in that, you know, frankly, at this point, tariffs don't matter, right? I mean, I think they actually matter a little bit for the U.S., I.E. they're going to hurt the U.S. a little bit more. I mean, the tariffs that the U.S. is imposing on China because obviously that is increasing the price of Chinese imports. 120% tariffs should be prohibitive, but I'm guessing there are a few things that the U.S. can only source from China and that there is not going to be a suitable substitution for in the near term. So to the extent that they continue to do that, that actually is just increasing costs for, I mean, it's almost certainly going to be firms. These are going to be intermediate goods, I think, right? Um, consumer goods, I think consumers will just do without. But basically, for the vast majority of goods, tariff levels are already at a prohibitive level. So, you know, if Trump comes back and slaps another 50% or 100% on and China does the same, I don't think that really matters anymore. Maybe we'll end up in an escalatory cycle that is kind of more pro forma than real. That said, I mean, I think at this point, you have two really big egos who neither one of which wants to seem weak, right? And so, it's hard at this point for me to really see an off-ramp. I don't see Trump suddenly saying, you know what, let's just talk this out. This has gone too far, and I certainly don't see the Chinese extending any sort of an olive branch either.
[00:13:13] Andrew Polk: Let me jump in with a little bit maybe more positive spin. We'll get into sort of best and worst case scenarios here in a minute. But I think in a way, as you say, like I actually had a client yesterday ask if, you know, this ultimately just becomes what she called a number shouting match, where Donald Trump says, well, I'm at 200, and Xi Jinping says, well, I'm at 300, and you know, I'm at 400. I mean, and it doesn't matter because there's no trade happening because it all stopped basically at 60%. And in a way, that's like if that happens, it's kind of one of the better case scenarios in my view. But leaving that kind of unlikely development aside, I actually think that today's move by the Chinese, the delta from Friday to today is positive, right? I think Friday was like pretty aggressive, right? They did the listings, the control listings, the UEL listings, investigation into DuPont, some outright bans on some things, and probably most significantly, the rare earth elements export controls. I mean, and of course, the tariffs. I saw Friday as a pretty aggressive, more aggressive actually, than what they did in February and March in the first two rounds of 10% tariffs this year. I argued that even though it was more aggressive, it still wasn't escalatory because, you know, there were sort of off-ramps built into all those. So, for most of the UEL listings, there weren't specific punishments for those companies, and most of them are defense companies, so does it really matter? They don't have any business in China. For the rare earth elements export controls, they were just restrictions, not prohibitions, so they just require licenses, and they specifically chose heavy rare earth elements, which China does not basically sell to the U.S. They sell them to Japan, who, you know, processes them, puts them into magnets, and then sells those magnets to the U.S. So it's something that really wasn't hitting the U.S. directly, and China can just provide licenses and that commerce can generally go on unimpeded. And so, the point is, Friday's move was aggressive, but I thought reasonable and really kind of matched the U.S.'s intensity. But I said, I don't think that's how Donald Trump is going to see this. And lo and behold, he did not. And so, you know, to some extent, I mean, I got to say like it was maybe a good move for Donald Trump to just go, I'm going to go to 50 on China. I mean, that's a pretty strong disincentive for everyone else not to respond, right? Not to retaliate because he's saying I really will go nuclear on you. So I think that was kind of an interesting move from his side. But then obviously, China had to retaliate again. But today's move, you know, they matched the 50%, but then they just did a small number of UEL listings and a small number of control listings. And to me, as a China analyst, professional China analyst, that's a pretty clear sign that they're trying to say, okay, we're still hitting back, but we're taking a little bit of a softer touch and we do not want to get into an escalatory spiral. The problem is, I don't know if again, Trump will see that that way or not, or if the Trump team, you know, has China analysts that are savvy enough to kind of read that signal. So I don't know, what do you think about that? Am I wrong? Are we just totally cooked or is this the Chinese kind of saying, okay, let's hold our horses?
[00:19:39] Trey McArver: Yeah, no, I mean, the Chinese have been in a trade war with the U.S. for seven years, and I think what they've shown throughout that time is that they don't want the trade war. Obviously, the folly of all of this is that imposing tariffs on imports is bad for your economy, right? And the Chinese, I mean, look, obviously, there can be positive externalities from doing that, and I understand the reasons that the U.S. and other countries want to do that in certain areas at certain times. There are like perfectly smart, reasonable people can come to that conclusion that that that is the best policy for their economy. But it's also, it's not controversial that from a macroeconomic point of view that tariffs are economically inefficient, right? And I think China has known that all along, right? China has always found itself in this place where it feels the need to respond, to basically show strength to the United States, but also understands that actually these responses are not really in its economic interests, right? And so I think you see that again in what I think you're right, is a relatively restrained response, which practically actually has almost no impact on China's economy, right? Like these 17 companies that have been called out are not buying a ton of stuff from China already. I mean, they just announced it a couple hours ago. I'm sure that our colleagues are looking into find out exactly who these companies are and what their ties are to China. But my guess is that they are companies with little to no ties to China. And also, as we already said, the additional 50% tariffs doesn't really matter when you've already got tariff levels that are that are so high.
[00:24:42] Andrew Polk: By the way, they're almost all defense companies, U.S. defense companies that don't do business in China.
[00:24:46] Trey McArver: Yeah, of course. And look, you know, I mean, I can match your kind of glass half full, rosy outlook, Mr. Sunshine, by pointing out that that the Chinese did release a white paper on trade with the U.S. or or with the trade war. Let me see, I can find out the exact name. China's position on some issues concerning China-U.S. economic and trade relations.
[00:26:11] Andrew Polk: Very oblique.
[00:26:12] Trey McArver: Released today, a white paper. What a coincidence. Here's how that paper ends. Trade wars produce no winners, and protectionism leads up a blind alley. The economic success of both China and the U.S. presents shared opportunities, rather than mutual threats. The U.S. side is expected to join forces with the Chinese side to pull in the same direction pointed out by the two heads of state in their phone conversation earlier this year. Following the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, the two countries can address their respective concerns through equal-footed dialogue and consultation and jointly promote the healthy, stable, and sustainable development of bilateral economic and trade relations. So, I mean, China's still putting out statements like that.
[00:27:02] Andrew Polk: So, well, here's the question then. Was it a mistake for them to retaliate? We'll get into my view on that, but that's one part of the question. And two, we've already said that this is kind of it seems like Trump's misreading China's incentives and resolve and all this stuff. Does China's retaliation, both now and in previous rounds, fundamentally come from a misunderstanding of what the U.S. is doing and the U.S. incentives and how the U.S. will react? So what are your thoughts on those two questions?
[00:27:30] Trey McArver: Well, I think the difficulty for China has been, and frankly, it's the difficulty for all of us, right? Like, let's let's face it. This is Donald Trump's world, and we're just living in it, right? And so the problem that we all face is that we don't really know what he wants when it comes to a lot of issues. Now, we know, I think when it comes to trade with China and trade more broadly, we know that he wants to get rid of the trade deficit. But I think the key question for China is actually, from Beijing's point of view, right, is, is this about a trade deficit or is this about a broader effort to decouple from China and isolate it on the world stage? So I actually don't think that's Trump's goal. I don't think that's really the way he thinks about things. But I also know that that is the way that a lot of people in D.C., in the administration, and around the administration think about things, right? And that is their goal, right? So I think it's very difficult to know what the U.S. end game is, and I think if that's the case, it also makes it difficult to know exactly how you should play it in Beijing. I mean, if ultimately the goal is to decouple, then is there a whole like, there's not much that China can do about that, I don't think. But if it's not, then they can, right?
[00:29:09] Andrew Polk: Yeah.
[00:29:10] Trey McArver: And so, I think that is part of the difficulty that Beijing is having. And we have just heard this for months, right? I mean, just every, every kind of indication you get out of the Chinese system is like, what do they want? What's going on here? Can you just tell us what you want, and maybe we can figure out a way to to come to some sort of agreement? And I think that is the fundamental problem is that there's not a kind of clear indication from the U.S. exactly what they want from China. Now, look, I don't want to give China a free pass. I mean, I feel like there are things that the U.S. wants that China should understand that they kind of seem to be unable to understand. You know, getting back to that energy, this is what frustrates me right now is I actually just feel like both sides are not very competent. Neither side is doing their country or their people a great service in handling their foreign relations right now.
[00:31:14] Andrew Polk: Yeah, well, I will say, it's also true that it's not just for China that China doesn't know what the U.S. wants. Like no one throughout the world seems to want to know what the U.S.'s end game is with this trade war, and I don't think necessarily the U.S. knows, right? Because there have been some countries that have said, we'll drop our tariffs to zero. And the response is, well, zero tariffs isn't enough. You also need to drop your non-tariff trade barriers, and they're like, what non-tariff trade barriers? And they're like, you know, the ones you use, like, you know, they're not specific. So I think China's not alone there. In terms of whether or not it was a mistake for them to retaliate to the first round of tariffs, it's a tough one because part of me looks at it and says, at least China's sticking up for itself. Every other country is just picking up the phone and essentially groveling for the most part. Not every country, but everyone's trying to just get Trump on the phone, see if we can negotiate. And for the Chinese, at least they're saying, you know what, we're not playing this game. Because I think it's always a fool's errand to get into a negotiation when you don't know what the other side wants, right? When it's not clear because then from the beginning, you're basically negotiating against yourself, right? So, in a way, I I sort of have respect for the move that says, you know, we're going to hit you back, we're not going to escalate or we're going to try not to escalate. But we're going to match your energy, and we're here if you want to talk, but we're not going to get pushed around. That said, I mean, it is crazy that there is not the political space in China for them to sort of take the higher ground and say, you know what, tariffs are self-defeating. Instead of raising tariffs on the U.S., we're going to cut tariffs on everybody else. We're going to talk to the Europeans, we're going to talk to the the Japanese, other countries in Asia. And we're we're going to truly like take the mantle of more open and free trade. But there are political constraints on that happening, and so sort of China, I think Xi Jinping is sort of locked into this, I have to be tough, I have to hit back. And so we just get in this very, you know,
[00:32:12] Trey McArver: Well, I mean, I would push back. This is a big question, and now we are just kind of getting into speculative territory. But again, it's an important thing to speculate about, right? Because I do think it's having a big effect on how the world works. But saying that there's no political space, that rings hollow to me, in the same way that
[00:32:30] Andrew Polk: I would, you think Xi Jinping doesn't have constraints on his ability to respond creatively to these broadsides from the U.S.?
[00:32:38] Trey McArver: Yeah, yeah, I do. I mean, I don't know, right? But I think that there is certainly scope, not least because you and I know this. This trade war did not come out of the blue. Trump's presidency didn't come out of the blue. Tariffs didn't come out of the blue. There's been a big discussion about this for a long time in China. We know that in the like kind of policy debate discussion, there has been discussion of this kind of high-road approach, right? So the idea is out there, and of course, is supported by some, certainly, right? Now, they might all be kind of pinhead academics on the kind of periphery of the party state. But maybe not, you know, because usually those people do have influence and inside as well. And there and their their arguments are taken seriously. And I think also, I mean, I think that Xi Jinping is similar to Donald Trump in that he can really pull people along with him, right? And if he says, guys, look, this is how I'm going to approach this. This is the way we need to do it, and here is why, because also the kind of counterfactual we're talking about here is not a crazy one. It's like, oh, what if he just took the approach that would advance China's interests? Like, you know, like I think he could pull that off. China is the elite politics and the decision-making at the top. Obviously, all of these decisions are taking place at the very top right now, right? Like, so we can do better when it comes to the the granular regulatory stuff that we deal with with some of our clients. But actually figuring out, okay, these like giant moves and how how are they going to play them, especially when we're in such uncharted territory, is difficult. I think it's all about, or I think obviously, Xi Jinping is the most important actor, and I have a feeling that what we are seeing is probably more his personal, maybe even emotional response, rather than, you know, the kind of collective wisdom of the party state or the political class in China.
[00:35:50] Andrew Polk: I hope you're wrong about that, but I suspect you might be right. But it is concerning because that like just the emotional responses to mercurial individuals or at least currently mercurial individuals, I don't know if Xi Jinping's always that way. Donald Trump is always that way. But those are the two making decisions and really driving things is concerning. We'll get into sort of worst-case, best-case scenarios, which that could play into worst-case scenario. But before we do that, I actually want to circle back to something you kind of touched on. I should have warned people at the top that this was going to be a little bit more free-flowing discussion today because we're sort of processing this in real-time. But you kind of talked about sort of people around Trump and in D.C. sort of thinking about the broader decoupling narrative. My question for you is, do you think the tariffs, the tariff move, the Liberation Day in particular, was primarily about China, or was it just about broader global trade? And presuming the answer is no, is it becoming about China? And is that a problem?
[00:39:57] Trey McArver: So I don't think it was about China. I mean, you can actually see very easily that it's not about China by seeing how the U.S. has treated the E.U., which is another one of kind of Trump's kind of old bugbears, right? You know, I mean, the E.U. came back and said, fine, we'll drop all our tariffs, right? And I think if your whole goal was to isolate China, you know, E.U. is not the center of transshipment, you know, you can argue that everything against Mexico and Vietnam and even Canada a little bit, you can argue that that's all actually like aimed at China. But I think saying that the E.U. is aimed at China, it doesn't really make much sense. And I think actually, if you really wanted to isolate China, what you would do, if you're Trump, if you're the U.S., is you throw down the barriers with Canada and Mexico, you throw down the barriers with the E.U., you know, and you really create a much stronger trading bloc with your allies, and what we've seen is that Trump's not willing to do that, right? Now, could this become about China? Yes. Yes, yes, and yes, right? Because for for two reasons. One, first of all, China's kind of made it about China. What other country is dominating the headlines of this trade war? It's China, right? And so now, I think even for Trump, China is at the center of this thing. And then, as we've kind of already discussed, there is a whole group of people that want this to be around Trump that want this to be about China, right? And so I now see this kind of path forward where those people push their agenda. They can sell it to Trump because through isolating China, he's still can in many ways follow through on his promises to like bring back manufacturing and and reorder global trade. But if he can also make deals with Japan, with Vietnam, with the E.U., then I think he will also go a long way towards calming the markets as well. He's been pretty resolute thus far, but I think that, you know, there is a time limit on how much kind of market and economic turmoil he can stomach, right? And so I do think that that might be his kind of Goldilocks path out of this is to just like decouple from China but actually make deals with everybody else. That that, you know, ideally, I think would reduce, you know, increase trade and investment flows between China and those other countries. Now, I don't know if he has it in him to do it, to be honest.
[00:45:46] Andrew Polk: Yeah, and so obviously he's not necessarily famous for his, you know, sustained attention on a given issue. But I will say this is a perfect segue into what I want to talk about next, which is potential worst-case scenarios. To me, I fully agree with you. I don't think it started about China, and I think still in Trump's mind, it's still about tariffs, right? Fundamentally like he thinks tariffs are the best tool. It's about trade imbalances in his mind. And so, I think if he responds to this latest response from China, it will just be another round of tariffs. And then we get into the number shouting game that we talked about that. And that is probably fine, right? If just, okay, we go from 100% to 150% to 200%. The real worst-case scenario to me is exactly what you said. Not only that maybe people around him come to him and say, you know, we could also use other things than tariffs, like sanctions, secondary sanctions. We could sanction Chinese financial institutions. We could really ratchet up export controls. I worry that the worst-case scenario is it becomes personal, just about China to Trump, and it's not about tariffs anymore and balancing trade. Then he like a switch flips and he says, I just want to beat China now. Bring me every tool in the toolkit and let's go one by one. And this moves quickly beyond tariffs, and then obviously, China has to respond to all those things. And then it's like what was an escalatory spiral is just like an escalatory rocket. What do you think the chances are of that happening, or do you see a different kind of worst-case scenario?
[00:49:20] Trey McArver: No, I think that's the good worst-case scenario. I'm happy to just hypothesize about that one. I'm sure we could come up with some other ones. I mean, obviously, you know, the worst worst-case scenario is war, right? I mean, if we really want to go there, like that's not on the horizon, but it's gradually casting its shadow over the edge of kind of what the possible outcomes could be. Certainly, you can imagine really bad outcomes to all of this. But yeah, obviously, we're very, very far away from that.
[00:52:52] Andrew Polk: Well, somebody in the company was asking me about, you know, have I seen the moves in bond yields and, you know, do you think the Chinese are dumping treasuries? So from their side, they have tools as well. And my response was just like, that's the nuclear option or one of the nuclear options from China's side. And I just said, that could happen. You know, it's never really seemed like a plausible option for China, but in this worst-case scenario, I actually think it it potentially is. But I said, you know, we're at least 10 steps between here and there, right? They're not going to pick up the nuclear option next or do it now. And so, we will see, you know, I think there's a lot of in between. But just to end on a a little bit of a brighter note, let's talk about first, what the best-case scenario might be. And actually, maybe that ultimately the best-case scenario isn't even a brighter note, probably. And then I want to talk a little bit about what we expect from China in terms of policy response to support the domestic economy. So, what's your best-case scenario here?
[00:59:15] Trey McArver: Look, I mean, as you have said forever, you know, and as we have said kind of as a company, is that with the uncertainty that we're living with, the range of possible outcomes is vast, right? And within that broad dispersion of outcomes, there are lots of really good outcomes, actually. Like it's not impossible. Now, I kind of think U.S.-China relations are done in a way, U.S.-China economic relations. I don't think there's much walking back from this. But what's so interesting about this moment is that the U.S. and China are not the only two players in this game, right? Calling it a game doesn't quite feel like it's lending the right level of gravity to the situation. I mean, I think the positive outcome that you could see is that this leads to some sort of competitive liberalization among countries, right? That you do see, you know, I mean, the real best outcome would be that the U.S. goes to Vietnam or whoever and says, you know what, we're dropping all tariffs on you. And then China goes to them and says, well, we're also dropping all tariffs on you. And, you know, actually all of this kind of spurs countries to, you know, lower barriers to trade and investment. I think the other thing is that on the China side in particular, and this will be a nice segue, I guess, into what they're going they can do domestically is I think also they could use this, I think, to push forward on those long-stalled. By the way, I think it's a little bit simplistic. We always talk about long-stalled reforms in China. They're just incomplete, right? My personal view is that China is a total kind of two steps forward, one step back type of thing, and that basically, you can always cherry-pick your data or your examples to find examples of China either liberalizing or backsliding, right? And so, but I do think there's obviously a lot more that China could do on the liberalization front, on the market reform front that this could really force policymakers to take on in a more concerted way than they've they've been willing to before.
[01:06:21] Andrew Polk: So that's interesting. I think we just switched places because your best-case scenario is much rosier than my best-case scenario. In part because I think even if, you know, most countries start to bring down tariffs, the U.S., I mean, there like lowering tariffs to zero by the U.S. does not seem to be on the table. Like even if quote-unquote deals are struck, I think the U.S. is still going to have probably the highest tariff level, average tariff level that we've seen in several decades. Even at the end of this if they come down. So, I'm not super optimistic on that side. On the China U.S. side, I personally think the best-case scenario, say for the next six months, best-case scenario is that no one escalates further and no one talks to each other. Just we stop where we are, right? Donald Trump doesn't see the 50% from today and say, okay, I need another 60. He just says, all right, whatever. I I told them I was going to raise if they retaliated to the first time. I didn't say I would retaliate to the retaliation, so I don't have to. And so, we just kind of stop where we are. There's a cooling-off period. Some back-channeling happens, but no official talks happen. And then six months from now, or something around there, some event happens that allows for the two sides to have a dialogue. And that to me is best case, and that's best case riding on quite a bit of luck and both sides just sort of sitting on their hands. So, I'm kind of short-term pretty pessimistic on where this goes. But in the meantime, China's definitely going to be doing stuff to support its economy, right? So on the latest reporting is some time this week, probably tomorrow, the State Council will meet with a bunch of other regulators to look at things that they can do to support the economy. So, two questions. One is, how much do you think? I know you're not as much on the econ side as I am and Denny are, but how much should we be worried about the Chinese economy? Two, what do you think China can do to or will do to support the domestic economy in the face of all this?
[01:16:25] Trey McArver: Well, again, I mean, I'll answer simply, but I think you should take those questions. Like, I mean, the Chinese economy is going to take a hit, right? One of their largest export markets has just effectively closed the door. I've seen the estimates, I'm sure you have as well, that, you know, that's anywhere between it could take one to two and a half points off GDP growth. And of course, those may be kind of underestimating the impacts as well because, you know, I don't I'm not sure we could be entering into a global recession, so I'm not sure how much those estimates are like also factoring in just suppressed global demand, not just looking more at the bilateral trade. So that's not great. I mean, China will survive, right? You know, they'll probably still post positive growth. I mean, there probably really will be positive growth. You know, I mean, they may doctor the numbers a little bit, but it's not going to drive the economy into a recession, I don't think. And not least because, and maybe you can talk a little bit more about this, but they've got a lot of space on both the fiscal and the monetary side, right? I mean, you can cut rates. You've got triple Rs to cut. I mean, there's a lot of way you can definitely pump some credit into the economy. And you can also spend, right? You know, I mean, I think they definitely will if they need to.
[01:19:38] Andrew Polk: Yeah, so, I mean, that's all good points. I think you're right on. I I mean, actually, last time, the first Trump administration, the first episode of the trade war, didn't really hurt China's economy macroeconomically much at all, right? They offset most of the tariffs with currency depreciation. That's not going to be possible this time around, obviously, like they like these these tariff levels are so high that, you know, you can't depreciate the currency 100%. That creates too much financial volatility. So there will be an impact to growth. I don't know that it'll be as high as the S.U. stated, like 1 and a half to 2% of GDP growth. That's basically cutting, you know, at the high end, that cuts GDP growth in half. I don't know that, you know, exports to the U.S. account for half of growth. So, you know, exports to the U.S. are 14% of overall exports. So a big chunk, but that's down from 19% before the first trade war, the first, you know, episode of the trade war. So they have been actively diversifying away. And I would say, you know, they 100% planned for this. Like, do not think that they didn't fully game out insane level of tariffs. They hoped it didn't happen, but unlike, I think the rest of the world, who is absolutely shocked by what happened last week, I think the Chinese like thought this may be a possibility. And so they have fully planned for this, I think. And so I think they've got like options ready to go in terms of domestic support. I think they'll definitely boost support for exporters, export subsidies, which the U.S. is doing, which is just drives me nuts because it's like we're going to put tariffs on imports and then put subsidies, you know, they're cross-cutting policies that are completely inefficient. But they'll do that. They will definitely spend more from the central government, and the big question is just, how much do they spend and what do they spend it on, right? To your point, I think it could be an opportunity for, you know, Xi Jinping has really resisted using the government balance sheet to support consumers directly and therefore shift more towards consumption. And this may just break that logjam. He may just say, you know what, the only thing now that can support consumption, because investment's already high, we can't really push it up anymore because the property market meltdown. We are not going to go back to a property bubble. Exports are not there. Government spending's already high. The one thing that we don't really have is consumption, consumers buying things. And so I think this may just kind of finally convince him to say, all right, we're going to put money in people's pockets. And you're already starting to see subsidies for like housing purchases, like direct subsidies at the city level to purchase houses. And so I think they've got plenty of firepower. I think it'll mostly be fiscal. They'll do a little bit on the monetary side. But they're 100% prepared. And all that is to say, we don't know what the package is look like. They will probably roll it out a little bit slowly because they will want to see what the effects of all this are on the macro economy. So it's not going to come out like they'll announce like that they're thinking about these things in the next probably this week, maybe next week, but they're going to want to see the politburo is going to meet at the end of this month to talk about economic policy. We will get Q1 economic data in the next week. Sorry, the politburo is meeting at the end of this month, I don't know if I said the end of this week. But so there's some good opportunities to recalibrate. Obviously, the Q1 economic data won't really reflect these latest tariffs, but they'll know what economic momentum looked like going into the tariffs, and they'll want to see some data, I think, before they react. So I think they're not going to jump the gun and go crazy on stimulus, but I think they have a ton of options on the table because of everything I just said because they're preparing. And I and I really do think it'll be more geared towards households than we've seen, which will be a good thing. We'll see all as we go. One last thing, I know you got to go, Trey, but one last thing that I worry about, and maybe I get your thought on or I I don't know, I think I don't worry about it, but it may be a unintended consequence of all this is I think the Europeans are worried that all those goods that were going to go to the U.S. are going to flood European markets, right? And I think that's why the Europeans are trying to negotiate with the Chinese to stabilize trade. Because if you think about it, if you're an exporter, if this isn't even a decision at a country level, if you're an exporter, just a individual company, and you lose one of your biggest customers, you go to your second biggest customer, and you say, I'll give you a 70% discount or a 30% discount, will you buy twice as much? So, what do you think about that dynamic? And then we can wrap up.
[01:29:06] Trey McArver: Well, yeah, I mean, that's all anybody in Europe is talking about. Like that that's what everybody's kind of talking about, the flood of Chinese goods, the tsunami of Chinese goods that that's about to kind of hit Europe. So yeah, you know, I mean, very interesting that Premier Li Qiang spoke to EU Commission President Von der Leyen yesterday, and what was really interesting in the read-out from the E.U., I mean, the E.U. is trying to figure out what to do, right? I think we had all of the trade ministers from the 27 member nations met in Luxembourg on Monday, I think, to kind of plot out the response to the U.S. Part of that response is also dealing with the quote-unquote tsunami that's about to come from China. And so they agreed to try to set up some sort of mechanism to basically control for that, which is also working with third countries like to try to stop transshipments basically and to just like figure out how to manage all of this. It was interesting to me. It did not seem like much came out of the call between the E.U. and China. I think China is not really prepared to kind of seize the moment here. You know, I mean, I think China should be trying to address these concerns of countries head on, and at a time when there's so much kind of peak everywhere with the U.S., it is just such a golden opportunity to say, hey, look, man, crazy U.S. Like, what are we going to do about that crazy guy over there? And, you know, China just seems kind of incapable of doing that.
[01:38:38] Andrew Polk: Well, so the Europeans are worried about it, and it likely is going to happen. But we'll see kind of how those negotiations play out whether or not China can help to stop the flood of goods into the E.U. and whether it can take advantage of the moment. But this has been another good one, wide-ranging. Good energy today, Trey. I think, you know,
[01:39:57] Trey McArver: You disagree.
[01:39:58] Andrew Polk: But, covered a lot of ground as always. Thanks for being here, Trey. Really appreciate it.
[01:40:03] Trey McArver: Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:40:03] Andrew Polk: And thanks everybody for listening. We'll see you next time. Bye everybody.
