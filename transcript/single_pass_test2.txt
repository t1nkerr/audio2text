[00:00:11] Andrew Polk: Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Washington, D.C. I am once again joined by my Trivium co-founder, Trey McArver. Trey, great to have you on the podcast again. How are you doing? Are you ready to talk tariffs again?

[00:00:28] Trey McArver: Can't wait. So excited. Love tariffs. Can we just talk about tariffs forever?

[00:00:36] Andrew Polk: Well, we probably will. For listeners, we had quite a lively discussion before we started recording, so we're hoping to bring some of that energy to this podcast. There's obviously only one thing to talk about right now, and that's the ever-escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, which kicked into even higher gear this week. Today, we're going to discuss China's latest retaliation, both to the Liberation Day tariffs last week and the most recent addition of 50 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from China this week. China just retaliated by dropping an additional 50 percent tariff on U.S. imports into China as well. We'll talk about where we stand now and what the outlook is for a potential ongoing escalatory spiral or if there's any potential to de-escalate at some point. We'll talk about whether this was the right move for China to be the first in line to retaliate against U.S. tariffs. I have to say we got this wrong last week. We recorded just a few hours before the Liberation Day announcement from Donald Trump. Our thinking at that time was maybe China would give it a few days to see how the dust settled and see what the EU was going to do. But China retaliated within 48 hours, specifically on Friday morning in the U.S. We'll touch on what China can do to support its domestic economy to potentially offset the negative economic consequences that these huge new tariffs from Donald Trump will have. But first, we have to start with the vibe check. Trey, what's your vibe like right now?

[00:01:21] Trey McArver: I don't even know how to answer that question. I think my vibe will become obvious as we talk through the absolute dumpster fire that is the global economy and bilateral relations.

[00:01:31] Andrew Polk: My vibe is uncertain. I don't know where all this is going. Everyone I talk to is just hopeful it resolves quickly. My sense is it will not resolve quickly, not just the U.S.-China piece, but the U.S.-global piece. We're in for some volatility. I do worry about a potential U.S. recession and a potential global recession. We're trying to run a business here, and that's going to hurt. The economic outcomes seem patently obvious, and I just hope I'm wrong.

[00:03:00] Trey McArver: Yes, I know exactly what you mean.

[00:04:20] Trey McArver: Is there any point in a recap when there will likely be something else happening within 30 minutes?

[00:04:25] Andrew Polk: That's podcasting life. Just to timestamp this discussion for listeners, we are at 11:23 a.m. on Wednesday, April 9th. If anything we say is outdated by the time you listen to it, that's not our fault. Here's the recap from the last week. As everyone knows, Trump announced his Liberation Day tariff just a few hours after we recorded our last podcast. Trump hit China by far the hardest with 34 percent tariffs overall, which came on top of 20 percent tariffs already levied on Chinese imports in February and March. That brought tariffs implemented on China in 2025 to 54 percent. In some cases, those are on top of previously existing tariffs, so the average tariff rate on Chinese goods was near 70 percent as of last Friday. China took less than 48 hours to respond. Early on Friday morning in the U.S., China announced 34 percent across-the-board tariffs on all imports coming from the U.S. They announced new export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements. They added 16 U.S. companies to China's control list for dual-use exports and added 11 U.S. firms to the Unreliable Entities List, which restricts investment and commerce in the Chinese market. They launched an anti-monopoly investigation into U.S. biotech giant DuPont and an anti-dumping probe into imports of certain medical CT tubes from the U.S. They also banned sorghum from agricultural exporter C.D. USA Inc., along with import restrictions targeting two poultry exporters and a bone meal exporter effective immediately. Over the weekend and early this week, Donald Trump took exception to the retaliation, having said that if anybody retaliates to the Liberation Day tariffs, he will raise tariffs. So he added an additional 50 percent tariff on all goods coming from China as of today or midnight this morning. That brought the tariff rate on China's imports well over 100 percent, in some cases up to 120 percent. Between the 104 percent tariffs added since January 20th and the ones from the previous two administrations, many PRC goods are now taxed around the 120 percent rate. Late on Tuesday night, the White House also issued an executive order implementing a de minimis tariff increase from 30 percent to 90 percent. You see China having this multifaceted approach, and Donald Trump now having an increasingly multifaceted approach. We're now in the stratosphere in terms of how high these tariffs are. Of course, this morning, on Wednesday, China retaliates to the retaliation on the retaliation, announcing its own 50 percent tariffs. China's Ministry of Commerce also added a further 12 companies to China's export control list, and MOFCOM added an additional six companies to the Unreliable Entities List. That retaliation today is at least a shorter list of items than what was on Friday. Trey, what do you make of this most recent response from the Chinese? What do you think of the move today compared to last Friday? Are we in uncontrollable escalatory territory, or is there a chance to de-escalate?

[00:08:06] Trey McArver: First of all, as you already pointed out, I'm not sure anybody should be asking us what's going to happen because when we talked a week ago, we were saying China was going to slow-play this and sit back to see what everybody else did. Then, obviously, they hit back immediately. Given the way that Trump then hit back and China hit back again, it does feel like we're in an escalatory spiral. At this point, tariffs almost don't matter. I think they matter a little bit for the U.S., meaning they're going to hurt the U.S. a little more. The tariffs the U.S. is imposing on China increase the price of Chinese imports. 120 percent tariffs should be prohibitive, but I'm guessing there are things that the U.S. can only source from China for which there will not be a suitable substitution in the near term. To the extent they continue to do that, that is just increasing costs for firms on intermediate goods. Consumer goods consumers will likely just do without. But for the vast majority of goods, tariff levels are already at a prohibitive level. If Trump comes back and slaps another 50 percent or 100 percent on and China does the same, I don't think that really matters anymore. Maybe we'll end up in an escalatory cycle that is more pro forma than real. That said, at this point, you have two really big egos, neither one of which wants to seem weak. It's hard for me to see an off-ramp. I don't see Trump suddenly saying, "You know what, let's just talk this out, this has gone too far." And I certainly don't see the Chinese extending any sort of an olive branch either.

[00:10:14] Andrew Polk: Let me jump in with a slightly more positive spin. I had a client yesterday ask if this ultimately just becomes what she called a number-shouting match, where Donald Trump says, "I'm at 200," and Xi Jinping says, "I'm at 300," and Trump says, "I'm at 400." It doesn't matter because trade stopped basically at 60 percent. In a way, if that happens, it's one of the better-case scenarios in my view. But leaving that unlikely development aside, I actually think that today's move by the Chinese, the delta from Friday to today, is positive. Friday was pretty aggressive. They did the control listings, the UEL listings, the investigation into DuPont, some outright bans, and most significantly, the rare earth elements export controls. I saw Friday as a pretty aggressive response, more aggressive than what they did in February and March in the first two rounds of 10 percent tariffs this year. I argued that even though it was more aggressive, it still wasn't escalatory because there were off-ramps built into all of those. For most of the UEL listings, there weren't specific punishments for those companies, and most of them are defense companies, so it doesn't really matter as they don't have business in China. For the rare earth elements export controls, they were just restrictions, not prohibitions, so they just require licenses. They specifically chose heavy rare earth elements, which China does not basically sell to the U.S. They sell them to Japan, who processes them, puts them into magnets, and then sells those magnets to the U.S. So it's something that wasn't hitting the U.S. directly, and China can just provide licenses so that commerce can generally go on unimpeded. Friday's move was aggressive but reasonable and matched the U.S.'s intensity. But I said I don't think that's how Donald Trump is going to see this, and lo and behold, he did not. To some extent, it was maybe a good move for Donald Trump to just go to 50 percent on China. That's a strong disincentive for everyone else not to retaliate, because he's saying he really will go nuclear on you. I think that was an interesting move from his side. But then obviously China had to retaliate again. Today's move matched the 50 percent, but then they just did a small number of UEL listings and a small number of control listings. To me, as a professional China analyst, that's a pretty clear sign that they're trying to say, "Okay, we're still hitting back, but we're taking a little bit of a softer touch and we do not want to get into an escalatory spiral." The problem is I don't know if Trump will see it that way or if the Trump team has China analysts savvy enough to read that signal. Am I wrong? Are we just totally cooked?

[00:13:40] Trey McArver: The Chinese have been in a trade war with the U.S. for seven years, and I think what they've shown throughout that time is that they don't want the trade war. Obviously, the folly of all of this is that imposing tariffs on imports is bad for your economy. Obviously, there can be positive externalities from doing that, and I understand the reasons the U.S. and other countries want to do that in certain areas at certain times. Perfectly smart, reasonable people can come to that conclusion that that is the best policy for their economy. But it's also not controversial that from a macroeconomic point of view, tariffs are economically inefficient. China has known that all along. China has always found itself in this place where it feels the need to respond to show strength to the United States, but also understands that these responses are not really in its economic interests. You see that again in what is a relatively restrained response which practically actually has almost no impact on China's economy. These 17 companies that have been called out are not buying a ton of stuff from China already. I'm sure that our colleagues are looking into who these companies are and what their ties are to China, but my guess is that they are companies with little to no ties to China.

[00:15:42] Andrew Polk: They are almost all U.S. defense companies that don't do business in China.

[00:15:46] Trey McArver: Of course. And I can match your glass-half-full, rosy outlook by pointing out that the Chinese did release a white paper on trade with the U.S. or with the trade war. Let me see if I can find the exact name: "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations." It was released today. What a coincidence. Here's how that paper ends: "Trade wars produce no winners and protectionism leads up a blind alley. The economic success of both China and the U.S. presents shared opportunities rather than mutual threats. The U.S. side is expected to join forces with the Chinese side to pull in the same direction pointed out by the two heads of state in their phone conversation earlier this year. Following the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, the two countries can address their respective concerns through equal-footed dialogue and consultation and jointly promote the healthy, stable, and sustainable development of bilateral economic and trade relations." So China is still putting out statements like that.

[00:17:02] Andrew Polk: Here is the question then: was it a mistake for them to retaliate? We've already said that this seems like Trump's misreading China's incentives and resolve. Does China's retaliation, both now and in previous rounds, fundamentally come from a misunderstanding of what the U.S. is doing, U.S. incentives, and how the U.S. will react?

[00:17:31] Trey McArver: The difficulty for China has been, and frankly it's the difficulty for all of us: let's face it, this is Donald Trump's world and we're just living in it. The problem that we all face is that we don't really know what he wants when it comes to a lot of issues. Now we know, when it comes to trade with China and trade more broadly, that he wants to get rid of the trade deficit. But I think the key question for China, from Beijing's point of view, is: is this about a trade deficit or is this about a broader effort to decouple from China and isolate it on the world stage? I actually don't think that's Trump's goal. I don't think that's really the way he thinks about things. But I also know that that is the way that a lot of people in the administration and around the administration think about things, and that is their goal. So it's very difficult to know what the U.S. end game is. If that's the case, it also makes it difficult to know exactly how you should play it in Beijing. If ultimately the goal is to decouple, then there's not much that China can do about that. But if it's not, then they can. I think that is part of the difficulty that Beijing is having. Every indication you get out of the Chinese system is like, "What do they want? What's going to happen? Can you just tell us what you want and maybe we can figure out a way to come to some sort of agreement?" I think that is the fundamental problem. Now, look, I don't want to give China a free pass. I feel like there are things that the U.S. wants that China should understand that they kind of seem to be unable to understand. This is what frustrates me right now; I actually just feel like both sides are not very competent. Neither side is doing their country or their people a great service in handling their foreign relations right now.

[00:20:14] Andrew Polk: It's also true that it's not just for China that China doesn't know what the U.S. wants. No one throughout the world seems to know what the U.S.'s end game is with this trade war. I don't think necessarily the U.S. knows. There have been some countries that have said they'll drop their tariffs to zero, and the response is, "Well, zero tariffs isn't enough; you also need to drop your non-tariff trade barriers." And they're like, "What non-tariff trade barriers?" And the response is, "The ones you use." They're not specific. China's not alone there. In terms of whether or not it was a mistake for them to retaliate to the first round of tariffs, part of me looks at it and says at least China is sticking up for itself. Every other country is just picking up the phone and essentially groveling for the most part. Not every country, but everyone's trying to just get Trump on the phone to see if we can negotiate. For the Chinese, at least they're saying they're not playing this game. I think it's always a fool's errand to get into a negotiation when you don't know what the other side wants because from the beginning, you're basically negotiating against yourself. In a way, I sort of have respect for the move that says we're going to hit you back, we're not going to escalate or we're going to try not to escalate, but we're going to match your energy and we're here if you want to talk, but we're not going to get pushed around. That said, it is crazy that there is not the political space in China for them to sort of take the higher ground and say, "You know what, tariffs are self-defeating. Instead of raising tariffs on the U.S., we're going to cut tariffs on everybody else. We're going to talk to the Europeans, we're going to talk to the Japanese, other countries in Asia, and we're going to truly take the mantle of more open and free trade." But there are political constraints on that happening. Xi Jinping is sort of locked into this "I have to be tough, I have to hit back." And so we just get into this very personal dynamic.

[00:22:12] Trey McArver: Saying that there's no political space rings hollow to me. Do you think Xi Jinping doesn't have constraints on his ability to respond creatively to these broadsides from the U.S.? I don't know. But I think that there is certainly scope, not least because this trade war did not come out of the blue. Trump's presidency didn't come out of the blue. Tariffs didn't come out of the blue. There's been a big discussion about this for a long time in China. We know that in the policy debate, there has been discussion of this kind of high-road approach. So the idea is out there and is supported by some. They might all be pin-headed academics on the periphery of the party-state, but maybe not because usually those people do have influence and insight as well and their arguments are taken seriously. I also think that Xi Jinping is similar to Donald Trump in that he can really pull people along with him. If he says, "Guys, look, this is how I'm going to approach this, this is the way we need to do it and here is why," because also the counterfactual we're talking about here is not a crazy one. It's like, "What if he just took the approach that would advance China's interests?" I think he could pull that off. China's elite politics and the decision-making at the top, obviously all of these decisions are taking place at the very top right now. We can do better when it comes to the granular regulatory stuff that we deal with with some of our clients, but actually figuring out these giant moves and how they are going to play them, especially when we're in such uncharted territory, is difficult. I think obviously Xi Jinping is the most important actor and I have a feeling that what we are seeing is probably more his personal, maybe even emotional response rather than the collective wisdom of the party-state or the political class in China.

[00:24:51] Andrew Polk: I hope you're wrong about that, but I suspect you might be right. It is concerning because those emotional responses to mercurial individuals, or at least currently mercurial individuals, are driving things. Donald Trump is always that way. Those are the two making decisions and really driving things, and that is concerning. We'll get into worst-case/best-case scenarios, which that could play into. But before we do that, I actually want to circle back to something you touched on. Do you think the tariffs, the Liberation Day move in particular, was primarily about China or was it about broader global trade? Presuming the answer is no, is it becoming about China? And is that a problem?

[00:25:58] Trey McArver: I don't think it was about China. You can actually see very easily that it's not about China by seeing how the U.S. has treated the EU, which is another one of Trump's old bugbears. The EU came back and said, "Fine, we'll drop all our tariffs." And I think if your whole goal was to isolate China, the EU is not the center of transshipment. You can argue that everything against Mexico and Vietnam and even Canada a little bit, you can argue that that's all actually aimed at China. But I think saying that the EU is aimed at China doesn't really make much sense. Actually, if you really wanted to isolate China, what you would do if you're Trump, if you're the U.S., is you throw down the barriers with Canada and Mexico, you throw down the barriers with the EU, and you really create a much stronger trading block with your allies. What we've seen is that Trump's not willing to do that. Now, could this become about China? Yes, yes, and yes. China's kind of made it about China. What other country is dominating the headlines of this trade war? It's China. So now, I think even for Trump, China is at the center of this thing. And then, as we've already discussed, there is a whole group of people that want this to be about China around Trump. So I now see this path forward where those people push their agenda, they can sell it to Trump because through isolating China, he still can in many ways follow through on his promises to bring back manufacturing and reorder global trade. But if he can also make deals with Japan, with Vietnam, with the EU, then I think he will also go a long way towards calming the markets as well. He's been pretty resolute thus far, but I think that there is a time limit on how much market and economic turmoil he can stomach. And so I think that might be his kind of Goldilocks path out of this is to just decouple from China but actually make deals with everybody else that ideally would increase trade and investment flows between China and those other countries. Now, I don't know if he has it in him to do it, to be honest.

[00:28:46] Andrew Polk: He's not necessarily famous for his sustained attention on a given issue. But I will say this is a perfect segue into what I want to talk about next, which is potential worst-case scenarios. To me, I fully agree with you. I don't think it started about China, and I think still in Trump's mind, it's still about tariffs. Fundamentally, he thinks tariffs are the best tool; it's about trade imbalances in his mind. And so I think if he responds to this latest response from China, it will just be another round of tariffs. And then we get into the number-shouting game that we talked about. And that is probably fine if we go from 100 percent to 150 percent to 200 percent. The real worst-case scenario to me is exactly what you said, not only that maybe people around him come to him and say we could also use other things than tariffs, like sanctions, secondary sanctions. We could sanction Chinese financial institutions. We could really ratchet up export controls. I worry that the worst-case scenario is it becomes personal, just about China to Trump, and it's not about tariffs anymore and balancing trade. He flips a switch and says, "I just want to beat China now. Bring me every tool in the toolkit, and let's go one by one." And this moves quickly beyond tariffs. Then obviously China has to retaliate to all those things, and then it's like what was an escalatory spiral is just like an escalatory rocket. What do you think the chances are of that happening, or do you see a different kind of worst-case scenario?

[00:30:21] Trey McArver: No, I think that's a good worst-case scenario. Obviously, the worst worst-case scenario is war, right? I mean, if we really want to go there. That's not on the horizon, but it's gradually casting its shadow over the edge of what the possible outcomes could be. Certainly you can imagine really bad outcomes to all of this. But yeah, obviously we're very, very far away from that.

[00:30:52] Andrew Polk: Somebody in the company was asking me about the moves in bond yields and if I think the Chinese are dumping Treasuries. From their side, they have tools as well. My response was just that's the nuclear option, or one of the nuclear options from China's side. I said that could happen; it's never really seemed like a plausible option for China, but in this worst-case scenario, I actually think it potentially is. But I said we're at least 10 steps between here and there. They're not going to pick up the nuclear option next or do it now. And so we will see moves before we get to that worst-case scenario. But I truly think for China and for U.S.-China relations, the worst-case scenario is that this moves from the realm of "we're just back and forth on tariffs," which isn't great but it's not the worst thing in the world, to now Trump just making it personal and going after China. And then China, of course, has to retaliate. So we'll see as we go. Let's talk about first what the best-case scenario might be. And actually, maybe that ultimately the best-case scenario isn't even a brighter note. And then I want to talk a little bit about what we expect from China in terms of policy response to support the domestic economy. So, what's your best-case scenario here?

[00:32:15] Trey McArver: With the uncertainty that we're living with, the range of possible outcomes is vast. Within that broad dispersion of outcomes, there are lots of really good outcomes actually. It's not impossible. Now, I kind of think U.S.-China relations are done in a way, U.S.-China economic relations. I don't think there's much walking back from this. But what's so interesting about this moment is that the U.S. and China are not the only two players in this game. Calling it a game doesn't quite feel like it's lending the right level of gravity to the situation. I think the positive outcome that you could see is that this leads to some sort of competitive liberalization among countries, that you do see—the real best outcome would be that the U.S. goes to Vietnam or whoever and says, "You know what, we're dropping all tariffs on you." And then China goes to them and says, "Well, we're also dropping all tariffs on you." And actually, all of this kind of spurs countries to lower barriers to trade and investment. On the China side in particular, this would be a nice segue into what they can do domestically. I think also they could use this to push forward on those long-stalled—by the way, I think it's a little bit simplistic; we always talk about long-stalled reforms in China. They're just incomplete. My personal view is that China's a total kind of two-steps-forward-one-step-back type of thing and that basically you can always cherry-pick your data or your examples to find examples of China either liberalizing or backsliding. But I do think there's obviously a lot more that China could do on the liberalization front, on the market reform front, that this could really force policymakers to take on in a more concerted way than they've been willing to before.

[00:34:22] Andrew Polk: So that's interesting. I think we just switched places because your best-case scenario is much rosier than my best-case scenario. In part because I think even if most countries start to bring down tariffs, lowering tariffs to zero by the U.S. does not seem to be on the table. Even if deals are struck, I think the U.S. is still going to have probably the highest tariff level, average tariff level, that we've seen in several decades. So I'm not super optimistic on that side. On the China-U.S. side, I personally think the best-case scenario say for the next six months is that no one escalates further and no one talks to each other. We just stop where we are. Donald Trump doesn't see the 50 percent from today and say okay I need another 60, he just says alright whatever, I told them I was going to raise if they retaliated to the first time, I didn't say I would retaliate to the retaliation, so I don't have to, and so we just kind of stop where we are. There's a cooling-off period, some back-channeling happens but no official talks happen, and then six months from now or something around there, some event happens that allows for the two sides to have a dialogue. And that to me is best-case, and that's best-case riding on quite a bit of luck and both sides just sort of sitting on their hands. So I'm kind of short-term pretty pessimistic on where this goes. But in the meantime, China's definitely going to be doing stuff to support its economy. The latest reporting is sometime this week, probably tomorrow, the State Council will meet with a bunch of other regulators to look at things that they can do to support the economy. How much should we be worried about the Chinese economy? What do you think China can do to, or will do to, support the domestic economy in the face of all this?

[00:36:25] Trey McArver: The Chinese economy is going to take a hit. One of their largest export markets has just effectively closed the door. I've seen the estimates, as I'm sure you have as well, that anywhere between could take one to two and a half points off GDP growth. Of course, those may be underestimating the impacts as well because we could be entering into a global recession, so I'm not sure how much those estimates are also factoring in just a suppressed global demand, not just looking more at the bilateral trade. So that's not great. China will survive. They'll probably still post positive growth. I mean, they may doctor the numbers a little bit, but it's not going to drive the economy into a recession, I don't think. And not least because they've got a lot of space on both the fiscal and the monetary side. You can cut rates. You've got RRR's to cut. There's a lot of ways you can definitely pump some credit into the economy, and you can also spend. I think they definitely will if they need to.

[00:37:39] Andrew Polk: Those are all good points. I mean, actually, last time, the first Trump administration, the first episode of the trade war, didn't really hurt China's economy macroeconomically much at all. They offset most of the tariffs with currency depreciation. That's not going to be possible this time around. These tariff levels are so high that you can't depreciate the currency 100 percent; that creates too much financial volatility. So there will be an impact to growth. I don't know that it'll be as high as the estimates you stated, like one and a half to two percent of GDP growth. That's basically cutting GDP growth in half. I don't know that exports to the U.S. account for half of growth. Exports to the U.S. are 14 percent of overall exports, so a big chunk, but that's down from 19 percent before the first episode of the trade war. So they have been actively diversifying away. And I would say they 100 percent planned for this. Do not think that they didn't fully game out an insane level of tariffs. They hoped it didn't happen, but unlike the rest of the world, who is absolutely shocked by what happened last week, I think the Chinese thought this may be a possibility. And so they have fully planned for this, I think. And so I think they've got options ready to go in terms of domestic support. I think they'll definitely boost support for exporters, export subsidies, which the U.S. is doing, which just drives me nuts because it's like we're going to put tariffs on imports and then put subsidies; they're cross-cutting policies that are completely inefficient. But they'll do that. They will definitely spend more from the central government. And the big question is just how much do they spend and what do they spend it on? To your point, I think it could be an opportunity. Xi Jinping has really resisted using the government balance sheet to support consumers directly and therefore shift more towards consumption. And this may just break that logjam. He may just say the only thing now that can support consumption, because investment's already high, we can't really push it up any more because of the property market meltdown, we are not going to go back to a property bubble. Exports are not there. Government spending's already high. The one thing that we don't really have is consumption, consumers buying things. And so I think this may just finally convince him to say we're going to put money in people's pockets. You're already starting to see subsidies for housing purchases, direct subsidies at the city level to purchase houses. And so I think they've got plenty of firepower. I think it'll mostly be fiscal. They'll do a little bit on the monetary side. But they're 100 percent prepared. And all that is to say we don't know what the packages look like. They will probably roll it out a little bit slowly because they will want to see what the effects of all this are on the macroeconomy. So it's not going to come out—they'll announce that they're thinking about these things in the next probably this week, maybe next week, but they're going to want to see—the Politburo is going to meet at the end of this month to talk about economic policy. We'll get Q1 economic data in the next week. So there's some good opportunities to recalibrate. Obviously, the Q1 economic data won't really reflect these latest tariffs, but they'll know what economic momentum looked like going into the tariffs, and they'll want to see some data before they react. So I think they're not going to jump the gun and go crazy on stimulus, but I think they have a ton of options on the table. One last thing that I worry about, and maybe get your thought on, or maybe an unintended consequence of all this: I think the Europeans are worried that all those goods that were going to go to the U.S. are going to flood European markets. And I think that's why the Europeans are trying to negotiate with the Chinese to stabilize trade. Because if you think about it, if you're an exporter, this isn't even a decision at a country level. If you're an exporter, an individual company, and you lose one of your biggest customers, you go to your second-biggest customer and you say, "I'll give you a 30 percent discount if you'll buy twice as much." What do you think about that dynamic?

[00:42:06] Trey McArver: That's all anybody in Europe is talking about. The tsunami of Chinese goods that is about to hit Europe. So yeah, very interesting that Premier Li Qiang spoke to EU Commission President von der Leyen yesterday. And what was really interesting in the readout from the EU is that the EU is trying to figure out what to do. I think we had all of the trade ministers from the 27 member nations met in Luxembourg on Monday to plot out the response to the U.S. Part of that response is also dealing with the tsunami that's about to come from China. And so they agreed to try to set up some sort of mechanism to basically control for that, which is also working with third countries to try to stop transshipments basically and to just figure out how to manage all of this. It was interesting to me it did not seem like much came out of the call between the EU and China. I think China is not really prepared to seize the moment here. I think China should be trying to address these concerns of countries head-on. And at a time when there's so much pique everywhere with the U.S., it is just such a golden opportunity to say, "Hey, look man, crazy U.S. What are we going to do about that crazy guy over there?" And China just seems incapable of doing that.

[00:43:49] Andrew Polk: Well, so the Europeans are worried about it, and it likely is going to happen, but we'll see how those negotiations play out and whether or not China can help to stop the flood of goods into the EU and whether it can take advantage of the moment. But this has been another good one, wide-ranging. Good energy today, Trey. Covered a lot of ground as always. Thanks for being here. Really appreciate it.

[00:44:03] Trey McArver: My pleasure.

[00:44:04] Andrew Polk: And thanks everybody for listening. We'll see you next time. Bye everyone.
