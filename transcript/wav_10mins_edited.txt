Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, both joining us from Shanghai today. We'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you. I feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
It's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. We're also delighted to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing but is also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks. I'm doing good, Andrew. A longtime listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Love it. It's great to have both of you on, not only because I don't get to see you very much, but also because we're all in the same place, which is awesome. We're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether, being our overall policy guru and very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. We'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. Finally, we'll touch on the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, differ depending on whether you're talking about China from the outside or when you're on the ground here in Shanghai, Beijing, or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
The vibes are good. On a personal level, being here in Shanghai, I'm seeing some colleagues I don't often get to see. The weather's very nice. On the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
First of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work, with this company. I think we're doing great, and having you guys come here to Shanghai makes me feel super happy. So it's great. Nothing to complain. Now, regarding the general vibe in the China business environment, I think that gets interesting because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think if we are talking about Chinese private business, the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about why, what happened, later. But I think if we're talking about foreign business, it's probably on a different track. I think there have been some improvements for them. I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also, the external challenges they're facing now are getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. On balance, I don't know where that puts them. In general, compared to Chinese private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Well, we'll get into why that is. Why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and, as you say, why foreign multinationals in China have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you. I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just to show people a little bit behind the curtain on how Trivium works, we're a small company, but we have multinational problems, is what I say. Small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be face-to-face with our colleagues. It's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. Thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the main discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual. First, I always have to stress, we're not just a podcast.

All right, with that fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It happened over the past couple of days, so we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was held Monday and Tuesday, the 23rd and 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. It's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2023. US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically a speech from the Premier, talking about the economy. He's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Premier Li Qiang talked about. But also the Premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. That happened this year, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the Premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to meet with the Premier. The meeting with the Premier is usually the highlight for these executives. Giving that background... Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I just want to point out, I think if you look at the Premier's meetings with businesses, it could still be disappointing for some foreign businesses because the whole setting is primarily focused on US business, and the US delegation at the meeting was led by a Republican Senator. So,

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. You could still argue that kind of meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community. Also, the geopolitics, obviously, in the US-China relationship specifically, hang over everything. It's interesting you did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your homestead Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
He's here along with the delegation, potentially trying to lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so I don't want to jump too far ahead, but it seems to be all about the US business community, and the European and Asian communities are left wondering how they fit in. It just underscores the point that geopolitics hang heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message that you really got from Premier Li Qiang, or from senior government officials on the Chinese side? What message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? Give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
If it's not obvious,
