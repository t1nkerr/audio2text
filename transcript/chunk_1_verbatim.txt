Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk coming to you today from Shanghai. And I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. Feel excited about, you know, joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. Yeah. And then we're also glad to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. I'm a long time listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because, you know, I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether, being our, well, overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss, you know, the wider thinking of the business community in China as well as how consumers are feeling, sort of against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and then thirdly, last thing we'll touch on is kind of the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check and I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, you know, especially around US China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also, I mean, if on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, you know, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to sort of the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think, you know, first of all, kind of life is great. Almost kind of half my life is work, which is this company. I think we're doing great, you know. Also, have you guys come to Shanghai, it makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. Now, kind of like how it's kind of vibe, general vibe in regard to the China business environment. I think that's gets to kind of interesting, because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think, you know, if we are talking about kind of Chinese kind of private business, I think the vibe there is actually kind of going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about kind of like why, what happened, kind of later. But I think if we're talking about kind of foreign business, it's probably kind of in a different track. I think there are something kind of improvement, improved for them. I think that's probably on domestic from, but also, you know, I think on just in general kind of external challenges they're facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that put them. I think in general, they are compared to Chinese kind of private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems, is kind of what I say. Small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face to face with our colleagues and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So, really loving that. So, thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the media discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual.

So, all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days. So, we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So, it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024 and US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, you know, talking about the economy. It's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to meet. The premier, the meeting with the premier is usually kind of the highlight for these executives. But, yeah, kind of giving that background, oh, go ahead, Ether, go ahead.

Ether Yin:
No, I just want to kind of point out. I think if you kind of look at kind of that kind of premier kind of meetings with business, is still, I I could have kind of argue for some business, some foreign business still kind of disappointing because now kind of whole setting is kind of primary focused on US business. And I think that the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So, you can for still argument, you can still argue, you know, that kind of meeting is not kind of inclusive enough to address the kind of whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. And the geopolitics, obviously, in the US-China specifically relationship, hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year and we'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead, but it's kind of is all about the US business community and the European business community and the Asian community are kind of like, well, WCF, how do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what it was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, you know, from his what is the senior government or senior government officials on the Chinese side. What message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, you know, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious,
