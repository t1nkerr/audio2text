Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. And I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. I feel excited about, you know, joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. Yeah. And then we're also delighted to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. A long-time listener, first-time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because, you know, I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst and Ether, being our, well, overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss, you know, the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling sort of against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, last thing we'll touch on is kind of the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check, and I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, you know, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, the the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see. The weather's very nice, but also I mean, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, you know, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to sort of the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think, you know, first of all, kind of life is great. Almost kind of half my life is work is this company. I think we're doing great, you know, also have you guys coming in Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. If I kind of like how is kind of vibe, general vibe in regard to the China business environment, I think that's gets to kind of interesting because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think, you know, if we are talking about kind of Chinese kind of private business, I think the vibe there is actually kind of going up, especially compared to last year. If we can talk about kind of like why, what happened, kind of later. But I think if we're talking about kind of foreign business is probably kind of a different track. I think there are something kind of improvement improved for them. I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also, you know, I think on just in general kind of external challenges they are facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that put them. I think in general, they are compared to Chinese private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is. Why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing, just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems is kind of what I say, small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face-to-face with our colleagues and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the meat of the discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual.

So, all right, with that fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days, so we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, you know, talking about the economy. It's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier talked about. But also, the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders, and that happened this year, which was notable because last year, they cancelled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to the meeting with the premier. The meeting with the premier's usually kind of the highlight for these executives. But, yeah, kind of giving that background. Oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin:
No, I just want to kind of point out. I think if you kind of look at kind of that kind of premier's kind of meetings with business, is still I I could kind of argue for some business, some foreign business still kind of disappointing because now kind of whole setting is kind of primarily focused on US business. And I think that the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So, you can for argument you can still argue, you know, that kind of meeting is not kind of inclusive enough to address the kind of whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point and the geopolitics obviously, and the US-China specifically relationship hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation, trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead. But it's kind of is all about the US business community. And the European business community and the Asian community are kind of like, well, WCF, how do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec, and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what it was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, you know, from his what is the senior government or senior government officials on the Chinese side, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, you know, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is, you know, a fairly rare opportunity in in most cases. It's also it's an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So just for all those reasons, it's sort of an event not to be missed and really has drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. Um, it's also a chance to show that, you know, we're in China for China and they kind of express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign company to participate in China's development, we're going to continue to relax restrictions, to treat foreign companies equally with with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and just about, you know, Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture that Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope that these companies, as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. So that's that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question. You know, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions at least for, I mean, decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in, I mean, other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Is it or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have as strong of a voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a brave new world especially in the in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I mean, yeah, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, you know, hey, think about it, you you've you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it it it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, yeah, certainly in the past companies and and trade bodies have played a role in in influencing the trajectory of of uh US-China policy and and China's relationship with other countries. And so now I think, you know, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are sort of two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and and negative, sort of in the the lead up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in I think it was November. There was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to kind of win over votes to their side on that. And ultimately if those tariffs did go through, but I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to the sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. I mean, my immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and and sort of this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But I mean, it certainly it doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the the Trump administration, sort of maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminus goals with China. Well, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's a

Ether Yin:
Go ahead, Ether.

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I think that's actually a very interesting question and actually I want to kind of ask you guys about, I think in particular Andrew you, because, you know, most of the time we based in DC so you are very familiar with kind of the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared kind of Trump and Biden, under Trump administration, there's kind of more room for US business to influence the policy a little bit? My assumption would be my understanding with Biden, because his administration operated on certain kind of principles and kind of, you know, red lines, you know. And basically when US business have conversation trying to influence certain policies and when it kind of reach to, okay, this is kind of a national security matter for US government, then that's the end of conversation. There's no room for US business to continue kind of influence. But with Trump, it's more like there's basically no principles or not kind of many kind of red lines. Is there kind of more room for US business to influence his policies?

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking. As I often say, I mean this is great because you guys are in China thinking about, you know, what's what the US side is doing. We do obviously as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But in this is a great point and it's pertinent to of course what's happening at the CDF. I mean my view would be that basically, the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that basically, that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration, in the first Trump administration, Trump administration officials saying, basically your companies are part of the problem. You helped to create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done. And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way, you're part of the problem, but was also kind of maintained throughout the Biden administration for the the reasons that you said, which was, the Biden administration just said, well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them. Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses or a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump, on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all these other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, giving, you know, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration generally, and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin:
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's good to know. That's good to know, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
You have another question? I was going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually kind of, I mean, understand that actually kind of helps kind of reinforce kind of our understanding about just basically whether Prime Minister Li Qiang's call for business to kind of resist kind of the protectionism or these things kind of going to work. I think it won't. I think that's kind of the bottom line, just because, you know, for multinational companies, they are facing increasing kind of pressure either from their home country government or even from public, right? So because to certain extent, you know, the kind of like, you know, bring kind of jobs back, bring production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing. And the other thing I want to tell on the message is, you know, the premier wanted to send at CDF is really kind of domestic front. Is basically trying to assure foreign companies, you know, government has the back of economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when, you know, the government announced very aggressive or expensive kind of, you know, physical policies. I think we talked about that in previous kind of podcast. I think the other kind of key message the premier really trying to bring home at the CDF is that, you know, everyone knows kind of the things can get worse later this year if say, you know, Trump kind of very dramatically increased tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly. So one key message that Li Qiang trying to send is that we also, the policy makers also thought about that and we already have a plan. And this time will be kind of better prepared and before that even happens, we will release additional policies, I.E. policies not included at the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to set that message loud and clear just to assure, you know, if you are worried about the China's economy, you know, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like, we're willing to stimulate more. We've got a bunch of tools in our toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And oh, by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape and we're sort of going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, if you look at like just kind of all the kind of Chambers of Commerce kind of survey, foreign Chambers of Commerce kind of survey, uh, you know, last year, they're basically across Chamber of Commerce, the kind of top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this kind of geopolitical tension. And I think kind of this especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. And the second one is geopolitical tension. I think that kind of like the order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most of kind of multinational companies, geopolitical, top one concern, but economy, I think is still kind of like one of the the second concern. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is, I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of, you know, senior business executives, you know, some of our clients. And the mood was actually like, despite the economy being pretty bad, like the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024. Yeah, yeah.

Ether Yin:
Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So they were COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then 2023, people were sort of sending lower level executives through kind of trying to get their feet back into the China market. And then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was like a lot of positive energy around these business people finally being back in China. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on a little bit, but And then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying like, we've got the economy's back. We know the issues, but does anybody believe it? You know what I mean? Surely, where are business's heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I think in terms of kind of like the business kind of vibes, I think for Chinese kind of business, and even I sense that among the public a little bit is actually right after Chinese New Year, kind of the sentiment kind of getting to a start to improve or getting warmed up. I think,

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025. So February 25.

Ether Yin:
Yes. Yes. And and I think the biggest thing happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year, if you are kind of remember the deep fake overnight become a headline globally, right? Kind of tanked the US stock market, you know, even kind of temporarily, but still, basically made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to the both public sentiment and a business sentiment. I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular is that basically, over the past few years, you are under this kind of narrative or sense that we, by we, I mean kind of China's kind of economy or Chinese kind of industries being kind of suppressed by the US, either both government, you know, sanctions and also US business. But just because of kind of deep fake, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue that if that's true or not and and to what extent that's true. But still, that gave the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, you know, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that, you know, containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, you know, manufacturing, everyone want to figure out, you know, in their business, how they can integrate into this AI thing. And I think visibly in premier's kind of government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of kind of deep fake, they even changed some language in the government work report because some of the kind of AI initiative wouldn't be possible without, you know, deep fake's kind of overnight's kind of success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to, I think, global investors reevaluation of Chinese stock market and, you know, the the price going up, you know, a lot of kind of folks here has investment in that. That also helps to kind of boost kind of sentiment. And then that lead to March two sessions, you know, I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which is basically to the public and industry here that, okay, government will keep their promise that, you know, the policy, economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So I think that kind of changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I mean, I want to bring Joe in here because the reason I say that's huge is so I've just said I was at, you know, in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was sort of optimism just because like, it was the first time these senior executives had been in China. They felt like they were like re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled and over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024, I was in China at, you know, during both of those periods and it became evident at that point, like sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic business and domestic individuals was, I mean, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing market still under wraps, people don't want to spend money, just like, things are not good. And so hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months, that's really started to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've lived in China for what, I mean, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in in sentiment as well just among kind of yourself as a consumer in China, your network, you know, of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that all that?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with between a gap of several months, you can in some ways are better positioned to say, oh, this is different than the last time I was here. Whereas me, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot is you kind of don't realize the change until until all of a sudden we do. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether kind of just on the on the anecdotal level. Yeah, last year it was my my friends in Beijing. It was kind of doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people who were saying to me, well, my my parents kind of pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in and and in in terms of price and I kind of feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see kind of fewer closed storefronts, which I think is sort of been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well. And I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather is starting to get nice and maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, I mean, I think that there have been a number of I think developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about deep seek, but I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China may be feel like they're not so not so bad off. So I mean, there's certainly, you know, reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even something like the Xiaohongshu phenomenon where it was the first time in possibly ever, where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on on a large scale. I think, you know, whether or not, you know, they gained a fully accurate picture of one another. I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China. And there's a lot of aspects of how about the US which are, you know, quite troubling. Again, I mean, we can we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given kind of the ways that the information ecosystems are are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I mean, I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. And so, yeah, I mean, I I wouldn't say it's like a a massive night and day shift, but it's certainly just as a a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as as an economic indicator, it does seem somewhat better than it's been in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, Joe made a great point. I think the other kind of aspect here or contributing factor here is that actually kind of the Chinese kind of are kind of overprepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone expecting the second term will be, you know, very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still, you know, not great, but still kind of like, you know, better than expected. And also, on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China because, you know, seems like the US government is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like, it's US against the world. You know, everyone suffers, it's not just us. That also kind of helps you kind of like, you know, improve your how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's really interesting because just as you guys were talking, both of you, I was thinking about how, I mean for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business.
