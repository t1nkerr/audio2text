Andrew Polk:
The US side is like, it's not exactly clear "who speaks for Donald Trump." So that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geopolitical moment that we're in that's shaping the context for that. And we'll see what happens with this potential Trump-Xi meeting. But in the meantime, I wanted to talk about the last thing that we have on our list today, which we've been tracking closely: China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic lawfare, in terms of how they're choosing to hit back against US tariffs and export controls.

This week we had a pretty big new development on this framework with the State Council issuing new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. As a reminder, China passed the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, or AFSL, in 2021 as part of a larger effort to build a legal framework to strike back against foreign economic coercion, particularly from the US. These new regulations strengthen the enforceability of China's existing counter-sanctions toolkit by clarifying the law's scope and prohibited activities. Specifically, the regulations stipulate that "any foreign country, organization or individual that implements, assists or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development interests" is liable to be sanctioned. They also lay out specific punishments if you are sanctioned or listed under the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law. There's a list of punishments, and then finally, these regulations specify a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement.

So Joe, let me bring you back in or throw this over to you. We've got these bevy of foreign executives in Beijing, and Beijing's saying, "Hey, we're open for business, come invest." During that meeting, they implement or release these regulations that say, "Oh, by the way, here's how we can punish foreign companies if they comply with US or European sanctions." So, what's going on here? What do we make of it?

Joe Mazur:
Well, I suppose the overall message that China wants to send, putting it all together, is that, yes, we are open for business, we welcome you to participate in China's development, and we will continue opening and providing you a better business environment. But if you try to harm our economic interests or basically carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, then we have the power to strike back. In perfect fairness, this is the implication that underlies business in any country, right? No country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as harming its national security.

But what I would say is that yes, I think there is an inherent contradiction there, but I think it's also an effort to clarify or give a little bit of clarity to foreign companies about where the red lines are and what's at stake. A criticism about China's treatment of foreign companies in the past has been, "Well, it's random, it's opaque, you never know if you're going to be on the chopping block." And I think that China is really keen to move away from that narrative or to counteract that narrative by saying, "Look, here are the specific things that will get you in trouble. Here are the specific penalties that you can expect to face, and these are the specific organizations that are going to be carrying it out." I think that's the message that China wants to send. I don't know if that's going to be received as such by foreign companies because you're right, it does on the face of it seem a little bit contradictory. But I think the point here is that China wants to make it clear to foreign companies that you are welcome to do business in China so long as you follow the rules, and these are what those rules are.

Andrew Polk:
Great points. Ether, your thoughts on this, on the regulations from the Council on the AFSL?

Ether Yin:
I think my point will be that Chinese policymakers have shown this consistently for the past two years: they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress on that. And this regulation is just one of those, and I'm sure we'll see more next. My point is that I think the Chinese policymakers' intention with this is not to use those tools in the first place. This is purely for retaliation. If the US has put out either sanctions or tariffs that hurt the Chinese economy and industries, they will use these tools to retaliate. I think when they view it from that lens, they view it as self-defense. And unfortunately, foreign companies become the collateral damage of that.

Andrew Polk:
Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. What strikes me is that we've been covering all of what we call the economic coercion toolkit or the lawfare toolkit that China has been building up for several years now. We've been covering it very closely since 2018. Basically, this is one of the big things we've been waiting for because we've been telling our clients, "Hey, they can't really use the AFSL. It's not ready for prime time because they haven't done some of the detailed work to make sure that they know which agency is in charge of which aspects of the punishments." And these regulations address that issue, right? So, I mean, it's a very clear signal to me that the AFSL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time and that it will be used, as you said, as retaliation. And not, I think, proactively necessarily to punish foreign companies to try to get them to do China's bidding just in general, but even used as a reactionary or retaliatory tool. I mean, it just puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions tit-for-tat back and forth. What do you do if you're a business?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, so I would add to that, yes, I do think that this is probably a prelude to these regulations being used more extensively. If you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach. Yes, there have been some counter-tariffs, but much more targeted compared with the blanket US tariffs. And I think a bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. So yes, obviously that's going to be something that spooks foreign companies and particularly US companies. However, the companies that I'm thinking of in question, PVH Group and Illumina, there was also a fairly direct political tie-in, where they had both done things that were seen as kind of directly infringing on China's interests. So in PVH, that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains. And in the case of Illumina, that was lobbying against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. So I think it's not just going to be China pulling names of random US companies out of a hat and saying, "Oh, bad luck." I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to and say, "Yeah, you actively sought to harm our development interests. So now you're going on the list." So I mean that may or may not be comforting at all to US companies because it's possible that these are possibly things that will be applied ex-post facto. They did something a few years ago that China didn't like. And for that reason, they end up as part of the next round of retaliation. But yeah, I mean it will be primarily defensive. It won't be particularly random. I think there will almost always be a political tie-in.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, let me just make one observation before I throw it to you for the last word, Ether. I'll just say, Joe, that's a good point. And also, in both the case of PVH and Illumina, which they weren't put on the AFSL, they were put on the unreliable entities list. The punishment, as far as I know, there still has been no specific announced punishment for PVH. And then for Illumina, the punishment was sort of just like you can't import certain gene sequencers into China, but you can still make those gene sequencers inside China, where they have a big footprint. So a pretty kind of slap-on-the-wrist punishment. All that is to say, I do think they're going to use it more proactively, but I think they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here. So I just want to add that on to what you said, Joe, and then Ether, what do you think?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah. And finally, sorry, one more quick thing is it's a deterrent, right? The idea is, hopefully, it's the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on notice to say, "Oh, man, we really got to be careful about this." And to kind of reassess their operations, to say, "Are we doing anything that could run us a foul of these regulations?" So I think first and foremost, well, I mean, it is a defensive tool, but also it's hopefully one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books. I'm sure it will get used more extensively, but I think that that's sort of a secondary purpose of these regulations.

Ether Yin:
Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I want to add points you both kind of made, is that I think for multinational companies, the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously, which is an important point to remember. I think that cautiousness will be reflected in two fronts. On the first front, what we'll see is that if you kind of look at all the companies being put on the EU or other kinds of lists, I can see they're trying to basically outline the Chinese government's red lines by singling out one company who is doing very badly on that. If you look at PVH, it's about Xinjiang. If you look at Illumina, it's about biotech. I think the next one will be if they're going to do anything with the US chip industry. I mean, they already opened the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think by singling out this company, they're basically showing to the world, "Here are..."
