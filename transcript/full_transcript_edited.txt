Andrew Polk: Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. And I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin: Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. I feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. And then we're also glad to have our Head of Geopolitical Research, who's usually based in Beijing but is also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur: Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. A long-time listener, first-time caller.

Andrew Polk: Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because I don't get to see you guys very much, and we're all in the same place, which is awesome, but also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe being our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether being our overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then, thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, the vibes are good. On a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk: That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin: Well, first of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work, is this company. I think we're doing great. Also, having you guys coming to Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. If we talk about the general vibe in regard to the China business environment, I think that gets interesting because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think if we are talking about Chinese private business, I think the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. If we can talk about why, what happened, later. But I think if we talk about foreign business, it's probably on a different track. I think there is some improvement for them. I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also I think the general external challenges they are facing now are getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that puts them. I think in general, compared to Chinese private business, they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk: Yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you. I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. We're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems, is kind of what I say, small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be face to face with our colleagues. And so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Before we get into the meat of the discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual. First, I always have to stress, we're not just a podcast.

So, all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It happened over the past couple of days. So we're recording on Wednesday, March 26th. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, the 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So, it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, talking about the economy. It's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier, talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year, they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to meet. The meeting with the premier is usually kind of the highlight for these executives. But, yeah, kind of giving that background. Oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin: No, I just want to point out. I think if you look at the premier's meetings with businesses, it is still, I could argue, for some foreign businesses, still disappointing because now the whole setting is primarily focused on US business. And I think the meeting, the US delegation, is led by a Republican Senator. So, you can still argue that kind of meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, that's a good point. And the geopolitics, obviously, in the US-China specifically relationship hang over everything. It's interesting, you did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur: He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk: All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year, in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead. But it's kind of all about the US business community and the European business community, and the Asian community are kind of like, well, WCF, how do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec, and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, from his, from the senior government officials on the Chinese side. What message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur: Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, the CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So, just for all those reasons, it's sort of an event not to be missed and really has drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. It's also a chance to show that, you know, we're in China for China and they express their commitment to the China market. That's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this. And just about Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting, and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overtures the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving, and it's worth expanding. So that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question. The Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions at least for decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Is it or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a stronger voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I mean, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, you know, hey, think about it, you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries. And so now I think, you know, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are sort of two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative. Sort of in the lead up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in, I think it was November. There was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to kind of win over votes to their side on that. And ultimately those tariffs did go through. But I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to the sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. I mean, my immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and sort of this America First economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But it certainly doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO, like Tim Cook, lobbying the Trump administration, sort of maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminous goals with China. Well, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Ether Yin: Yeah, I mean, that's a...

Andrew Polk: Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin: I think that's actually a very interesting question. And actually I want to ask you guys about, I think in particular, Andrew, you, because you know, most of the time you based in DC, so you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared to Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, there's more room for US business to influence policy a little bit? My assumption would be, my understanding with Biden, because his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. And basically, when US business has conversations trying to influence certain policies, and when it reaches, okay, this is a national security matter for the US government, then that's the end of the conversation. There's no room for US business to continue to influence. But with Trump, it's more like there are basically no principles or not many red lines. Is there more room for US business to influence his policies?

Andrew Polk: Well, it's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking. As I often say, I mean, this is great because you guys are in China thinking about what the US side is doing. We do obviously, as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to, of course, what's happening at the CDF. I mean, my view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that basically that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration officials saying, basically, your companies are part of the problem. You helped create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem and so we're not going to listen to your voice, we're trying to undo the things that you have done. And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way, you're part of the problem, but was also kind of maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons that you said, which was, the Biden administration just said, well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them. Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses or a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump, on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all these other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, giving, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration generally, and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Andrew Polk: I mean, that's good to know. That's good to know, yeah. Do you have another question? I was going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin: No, I was just going to say that's actually, I mean, understanding that actually helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether Premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to resist protectionism or these things are going to work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because, you know, for multinational companies, they're facing increasing pressure either from their home country government or even from the public, right? To a certain extent, bringing jobs back, bringing production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing. And the other thing I want to, on the message, the premier wanted to send at CDF is really domestic front. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, you know, government has the back of the economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when the government announced very aggressive or expensive fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcast. I think the other key message the premier really trying to bring home at the CDF is that, you know, everyone knows things can get worse later this year if, say, Trump very dramatically increases tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly. So one key message that Li Qiang trying to send is that we, the policymakers, also thought about that, and we already have a plan. And this time we will be better prepared. And before that even happens, we will release additional policies, i.e., policies not included at the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to send that message loud and clear just to assure, you know, if you are worried about the China's economy, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like we're willing to stimulate more, we've got a bunch of tools in our toolkit, we've got a lot of dry powder. And oh, by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape, and we're sort of going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin: Yeah, totally. I mean, if we look at just all the Chambers of Commerce survey, foreign Chambers of Commerce survey, last year, they're basically across Chambers of Commerce, the top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this geopolitical tension. And I think this, especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. And the second one is geopolitical tension. I think that kind of like the order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most multinational companies, geopolitics is the top one concern. But economy, I think is still one of the second concerns. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk: Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of, you know, senior business executives, some of our clients. And the mood was actually, despite the economy being pretty bad, the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024.

Ether Yin: Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Polk: I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So they had COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then 2023, people were sort of sending lower-level executives through, kind of trying to get their feet back into the China market. And then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was like a lot of positive energy around these business people finally being back in China. But then, throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on it a little bit, but And then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying like, we've got the economy's back, we know the issues. But does anybody believe it? You know what I mean? Surely, where are business's heads at?

Ether Yin: Yeah, totally. I think in terms of the business vibes, I think for Chinese business, and even I sense that among the public a little bit is actually right after Chinese New Year, the sentiment started to improve, or getting warmed up.

Andrew Polk: I think...

Ether Yin: That's just Chinese New Year 2025, so February 25.

Andrew Polk: Yes.

Ether Yin: Yes. And I think the big thing that happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year, if you all remember, DeepSeek overnight became a headline globally, right? It tanked the US stock market, even temporarily, but still basically made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to both public sentiment and business sentiment, I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular, is that basically over the past few years, you're under this narrative or sense that we, by we, I mean China's economy or Chinese industries, are being suppressed by the US. Either both government sanctions and also US business. But just because of DeepSeek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue if that's true or not, and to what extent that's true. But still, that gave the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, you know, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, manufacturing, everyone wants to figure out how they can integrate into this AI thing. And I think visibly in Premier Li's government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of DeepSeek, they even changed some language in the government work report because some of the AI initiatives wouldn't be possible without DeepSeek's overnight success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to, I think, global investors' revaluation of China's stock market and the price going up, a lot of folks here have investment in that. That also helps to boost sentiment. And then that leads to March two sessions, you know, I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing. Which is basically to the public and industry here that, okay, government will keep their promise that the economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So I think that changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk: So that's huge. I mean, I want to bring Joe in here because the reason I say that's huge is, so I just said I was in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF, 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was sort of optimism just because like, it was the first time these executives had been in China. And they felt like they were like reengaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled. And over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024, I was in China at, you know, during both of those periods. And it became evident at that point, like, sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses, and domestic individuals was, I mean, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing market still under wraps, people don't want to spend money, just like, things are not good. And so hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months, that's really started to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've been in China for what, I mean, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in in sentiment as well, just among kind of yourself as a consumer in China, your network, you know, of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that all that?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with between a gap of several months, you could in some ways are better positioned to say like, oh, this is different from the last time I was here. Whereas me, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot as you kind of don't realize the change until all of a sudden you do. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether, kind of just on the anecdotal level. Yeah, last year it was my friends in Beijing, it was kind of doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people, who were saying to me, well, my parents kind of pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in terms of price and I kind of feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see kind of fewer closed storefronts, which I think has sort of been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well. And I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather is starting to get nice, maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, and I mean, I think that there have been a number of I think developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about DeepSeek, but I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China maybe feel like they're not so not so bad off. So I mean, they're certainly, you know, reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even something like the Xiaohongshu phenomenon, where it was the first time in possibly ever where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on on a large scale. I think, you know, whether or not, they gained a fully accurate picture of one another, I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China. And there's a lot of aspects of the US which are, you know, quite troubling. Again, I mean, we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given kind of the difference that the information ecosystems are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I mean, I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. And so yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it's like a massive night and day shift. But it certainly just as a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as an economic indicator, it does seem somewhat better than it's been in the past year or so.

Ether Yin: Yeah, totally. I mean, Joe made a great point. I think the other aspect here, or contributing factor here, is that actually the Chinese are over-prepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone expecting a second term will be very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still, you know, not great, but still better than expected. And also on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China because, you know, it seems like the US government is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like it's US against the world. Everyone suffers, it's not just us. That also kind of tells you how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, I mean, that's really interesting because just as you guys were talking, both of you, I was thinking about how for several years now, we've really talked about the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to sort of put people onto a better path. And our thesis was kind of like, well, the government will have to do it. It'll have to do it at the third plenum, which happened last year. They'll do it at the two sessions. And it kept feeling like the government was missing these opportunities, but then here, the private sector, the deep seek thing comes and maybe it seems like, we'll wait to see. It's only been, you know, a month and a half or so. But maybe that was the catalyst that they needed and then I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, you know what? From that deep seek development, like you said, how important AI is and how we now have the path towards putting it into government policy, it's sporting at the government policy, and we see now a path for we see recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. And so it turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the purview or really even expectation of the Chinese government and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ether Yin: Yeah. And not to overuse that. But I do think, if you remember last year, things were great in Q1 and I think things started to go bad in Q2. I do want to say there are a few things here. Second, it depends on whether Trump decides to tighten the screw in China again, significantly increase tariffs. I think that does have a significant impact. And I think more importantly is if that happens, we or the policymakers do as they say, which is deploy additional policy support in a very timely manner. Because if that happens again, I can see this fragile confidence building up going to go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, so 100%. It is not a slam dunk that we are now on a new path. But this is our business. We watch this stuff closely and we try to see if we are on the new trajectory. But speaking that's a great actually perfect pivot point. Speaking of Trump and potentially in tariffs, this kind of constant, will they won't they reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet. And again, I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast to try to think about China's perspective on things and here and not make it all about US China, but with the CDF and kind of this context this week, I think this is particularly relevant. Diving into the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. And so just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC and they were expressing to me a point that I thought made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we're talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea. But just so you know, our normal operating procedure is to have working level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth, then we kick that up to the next level after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out to the next higher level, maybe it's the ministerial/cabinet level, those people work out, then we go up to the next level which might be the senior leaders or the heads of state. They meet, it's pretty much just kind of pro forma. They're just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That's how we like to operate, right? And I was like, well, those working level meetings don't seem like they're happening. They're like, no, they're not happening. And but obviously, Donald Trump, and so first of all, working level meetings, like I said, aren't happening. I think maybe not obviously, but Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the head of state and basically have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, sort things out and then go top down instead of bottom up, have everybody below them, then work out the details of how to get things done. So I guess, let me bring in Joe again here and then we'll bring you in again either. Do you think that's the right read on the situation, Joe? And secondly, I mean, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, I mean, I think that absolutely tracks as I mean, I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol conscious no matter where they're from, and I think that's especially true in the Chinese system where just the political, you know, politics is very choreographed in most respects. And beyond just sort of the simple questions of protocol, I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time obviously in US-China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. So, you know, we're talking about optics, right? There was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that's the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You're going to not only, you know, Trump's home turf in terms of being in the states, but his literal home turf. Yeah, you know, there were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because that a lot more of the protocol is then in their hands, they'd play the gracious host. And there have been another number of other kind of suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I'm now kind of of the opinion, I don't think one is imminent. It doesn't mean one won't happen, but I think that the Chinese side as you mentioned is very nervous about, I suppose, the very ad hoc way that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. And that sort of brings me to the second point, which is outcomes, right? So beyond the optics of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that Xi was not aware of or didn't agree to or anything like that. There's a lot riding on this meeting, right? I mean, Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the phase one trade deal from way back in 2020. So I mean, if it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US-China trade and economic tension, right? But equally, if it goes badly, I mean, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work and if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think grow increasingly dim and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain or at least agreeing to work towards something that'll help to satisfy both sides, that that reduces dramatically, right? And the fact that working level groups have apparently stalled out mean that it's going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it's really important that both sides get this right. And if they don't, I mean, I think it could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side doesn't want to see and ultimately would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ether Yin: Yeah, totally agree with you both. I think I just want to try and think through because, you know, our job is trying to be forward-looking. As you kind of talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. And I think what could happen is actually, you know, Andrew, you mentioned that Trump prefers a top-down approach and for the Chinese, they prefer a bottom-up. And I think the possible way out is probably to start from someone at the middle level, which is, both leaders appoint a deputy who is in charge of this and they can hash things out. And if you look back to Trump 1.0, it's basically Lighthizer hashed out a deal with Liu He, right? Now so far we haven't seen that level, very productive engagement at that level. I think Vice Premier Liu He had one call with the counterpart on the state side, but not much engagement so far. But I think it still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that process. It's basically they hop on the call saying, hey, this deal is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it. I think if one thing...

Andrew Polk: Can I ask you?

Ether Yin: Yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Polk: I was just going to ask you, so, I mean, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ether Yin: Liu He.

Andrew Polk: I'm struggling on the US side to think who it would be. Partly because I just, like I said, I think Donald Trump wants to take the lead and isn't quite inclined to back any of his cabinet secretaries to necessarily be the lead. I basically don't think he trusts them to take that over. This is my reading of it so far. Obviously, Daines, the Senator that we talked about from Montana, is trying to sort of make a play to become an envoy. So I mean, I'll just leave that US side aside for now because that's not quite clear to me who that would be, but my question for you is, who do you think it would be on the Chinese side?

Ether Yin: You know, it would be Vice Premier Liu He. He has a portfolio. US-China commercial relation is under him, and also he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. So he is a perfect person.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, yeah, great.

Ether Yin: And he is a very savvy operative, very good at enforcing whatever Xi Jinping wants.

Andrew Polk: And so he's in lockstep with Xi and knows sort of speak for Xi.

Ether Yin: Yes.

Andrew Polk: And I think that's the challenge on the US side. It's not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump. Okay, so that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geopolitical moment that we're in that's sort of shaping the context for that. And we'll see what happens with this potential Trump-Xi meeting. But in the meantime, I want to talk about the last thing that we have on our list today, which we've been tracking closely, which is China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic lawfare in terms of how they're choosing to hit back against US tariffs and export controls, etc. So this week we had a pretty big new development on this front with the State Council issuing new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So as a reminder, China passed the anti-foreign sanctions law or ASFL in 2021 as part of a larger effort to build a legal framework to strike back against foreign economic coercion, particularly from the US. And so these new regulations strengthen the enforceability of China's existing counter-sanctions toolkit by clarifying the law's scope and prohibited activities. Specifically, the regulations stipulate that, quote, any foreign country, organization or individual that implements, assists or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security and development interests, in quote, is liable to be sanctioned. And so they also lay out specific punishments if you are sanctioned or listed under the anti-foreign sanctions law, there's a list of punishments and then finally, these regulations specify a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement. So Joe, let me bring you back in or throw this over to you. You know, we've got these bevy of foreign executives in Beijing and Beijing's saying, hey, we're open for business, come invest. During that meeting, they implement these or release these regulations that say, oh, by the way, here's how we can punish foreign companies if they comply with US or European sanctions. So what's going on here? What do we make of it?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose the overall message that China wants to send, putting it all together, is that yes, we are open for business, we welcome you to participate in China's development and we will continue opening and providing you a better business environment, but if you try to harm our economic interests or basically carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, then we have the power to strike back. And in perfect fairness, I mean, this is sort of the implication that underlies business in any country, right? No country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as harming its national security, right? But I mean, what I would say is that yes, I think there is sort of an inherent contradiction there, but I think it's also an effort to sort of clarify or give a little bit of clarity to foreign companies about, you know, where the red lines are and what's at stake, right? So I think, you know, a criticism about China's treatment of foreign companies in the past has been, well, it's random, it's opaque. You never know if you're going to be on the chopping block. And I think that China's really keen to sort of move away from that narrative or to counteract that narrative by saying, look, here are the specific things that will get you in trouble. Here are the specific penalties that you can expect to face and these are the specific organizations that are going to be carrying it out, right? I think that's the message that China wants to send. I don't know if that's going to be received as such by foreign companies because you're right. I mean, it does on the face of it seem a little bit contradictory, but I think the point here is that China wants to make it clear to foreign companies that you are welcome to do business in China so long as you follow the rules and these are what those rules are.

Andrew Polk: Yeah. Yeah, great points, great points. Ether, your thoughts on this, on the regs from the council on the ASFL?

Ether Yin: No, I think my point will be, I think Chinese policymakers have shown this consistently for the past two years is that they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress on that. And this regulation is just one of that and I'm sure we'll see more next. My point there is that I think the Chinese policymakers' intention with this thing is not to use those tools in the first place. This is purely for, if the US has put out either sanctions or tariffs and hurting Chinese economy and industries, they will use these tools to retaliate. I think when they view it from that lens, they view it as we are doing self-defense. And unfortunately, foreign companies become the collateral damage of that.

Andrew Polk: Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. So what strikes me, we've been covering all the what we call economic coercion toolkit or the lawfare toolkit that China's been building out for several years now. We've been covering it very closely since 2018. Basically, this is one of the big things we've been waiting for because we've been telling our clients like, hey, they can't really use the ASFL, it's not ready for prime time because they haven't done some of the detailed work to make sure that they know which agencies in charge of which aspects of the punishments. And these regs, they address that issue, right? And so, I mean, it's a very clear signal to me that the ASFL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time and that it will be used as you said, as retaliation. And not, I think proactively necessarily to punish foreign companies to try to get them to do China's bidding just in general, but even used as a reactionary or retaliatory tool. I mean, it just puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions for tat back and forth. I mean, what do you do if you're a business?

Joe Mazur: Yeah, I mean, so I would add to that is, yeah, I do think that this is probably a prelude to these regulations being used more extensively. And just if you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach. Yes, there have been some counter-tariffs, but much more targeted compared with the blanket US tariffs. And I think a bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. And so yes, obviously that's going to be something that spooks foreign companies and particularly US companies. However, the companies that I'm thinking of in question, so PVH Group and Illumina, there was also a fairly direct political tie-in where they had both done things that were seen as kind of directly infringing on China's interests. So in PVH, that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, and in the case of Illumina, that was lobbying against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. So I think it's not just going to be China pulling names of random US companies out of a hat and saying, oh, bad luck. I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to and say, yeah, you actively sought to harm our development interests. So now you're going on the list. So I mean, that may or may not be comforting at all to US companies because it's possible that, these are possibly things that will be applied ex post facto. It's they did something a few years ago that China didn't like and for that reason, they end up as part of the next round of retaliation. But yeah, I mean, it will be primarily defensive. It won't be particularly random. I think there will almost always be a political tie-in.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, let me just make one observation before I throw it to you for the last word either, is I'll just say Joe, that's a good point. And also, in both the case of PVH and Illumina, which they weren't put on the ASFL, but were put on the unreliable entities list, the punishment, as far as I know, there still has been no specific announced punishment for PVH. And then for Illumina, the punishment was sort of just like you can't import certain gene sequencers into China, but you can still make those gene sequencers inside China where they have a big footprint. So a pretty kind of slap on the wrist-y punishment. All that is to say, I do think they're going to use it more proactively, but I think they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here. So I just want to add that on to what you said Joe and then Ether, you know, what do you think?

Joe Mazur: And finally, sorry, one more quick thing is it's a deterrent, right? The idea, it's hopefully, it's the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on notice to say, oh man, we really got to be careful about this and to kind of reassess their operations to say, are we doing anything that could run us afoul of these regulations? So I think first and foremost, it is the defensive tool, but also it's hopefully one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books. I'm sure it will get used more extensively, but I think that that's sort of a secondary purpose of these regulations.

Ether Yin: I want to add points you both kind of made is that I think for multinational companies, the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously is an important point to remember. I think that cautiousness will be reflected on two fronts. I think on one, on the first one, what we will see is that if you kind of look at all the companies being put on, you know, EUL or other kind of list, I can see they are trying to basically outlining the Chinese government's red lines by singling out one company who is doing very badly on that. You know, if you look at PVH it's about Xinjiang. If you look at Illumina, it's about, you know, biotech. I think, you know, the next one we're looking at if is if they're going to do anything with US chip industry. I mean, they already put Nvidia, open the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think by singling out those companies, they're basically showing to the world, here are a few red line issues for us. You know, that's one thing. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. So it's for each issue, we set an example. I think that's their approach. And the second one, I think exactly your point, Andrew, about there's, you know, maybe with the exception of Illumina, there's no punishment. I think it's still our view that the end goal here is that they are preparing, the Chinese have been preparing for getting back to the table with Trump and to negotiate a deal. And when both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage you have or bargaining chips you have, right? For Trump, there's a lot of chips because over the past three years there are so many tariffs, there are so many sanctions, so many companies Chinese companies are on the sanctions list. But if you look at Chinese companies, they don't have much bargaining chips. So they've been announcing those investigations without announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargaining chips. You know, if you remove certain Chinese companies off your list, I'll remove those US companies off my list, right? So I think that's the thing they've been trying to prepare.

Andrew Polk: Yeah, that's a great point. Great point. And I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground and just another quick plug, like we'll be watching all of this stuff, especially on the sanctions and export controls and lawfare side very closely and we help foreign, you know, non-Chinese companies and investors figure this stuff out and navigate it, you know, if you have an issue with this stuff or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at HQ@triviumchina.com. We'd love to work with you. But in the meantime, let's wrap it up there. Guys, Joe, Ether, so great to have you on the pod for the first time. I'm sure this is the first among many. So thanks to you both for being here.

Ether Yin: Yeah.

Joe Mazur: All right, thanks, Andrew.

Ether Yin: Good having this conversation with you guys. Yeah.

Andrew Polk: Absolutely and after this we can go grab some drinks together and hang out. All right guys, y'all take care. Thanks everybody for joining us and listening and we'll see you next time. Bye everybody.

Ether Yin: Bye everyone.
