Ether Yin:
Nvidia, open the the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think they by by singling out those companies, they are basically showing to the world, here are a few kind of red line issues for us. You know, that's one thing. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. So it's for each issue, we set an example. I think that's kind of their approach. And the second one, I think, exactly your point Andrew about there's, you know, maybe with the exception of Illumina, there's no punishment. I think it's still our view that the end goal here is that they are preparing, the Chinese is being preparing for getting back to the table with Trump and to negotiate the deal. And when both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage you have or bargain chips you have, right? For for Trump, there's a lot of kind of chips because it with past few years there are so many tariffs, there are so many sanctions, so many Chinese companies on on the sanction list. But if you look at Chinese companies, they don't have much kind of bargain chips. So they've been kind of announcing those investigations without kind of announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargain chips. You know, if you remove certain Chinese company off your list, I'll remove those US company off my list, right? So I think that's kind of the thing they've been trying to prepare.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a great point. Great point. And I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground and just another quick plug like we'll be watching all of this stuff especially on the sanctions and export controls and lawfare side very closely and we help for, you know, non-Chinese companies and investors figure this stuff out and navigate it, you know, if you have an issue with this stuff or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at hq@triviumchina.com. We'd love to work with you. But in the meantime, let's wrap it up there. Guys, Joe, Ether, so great to have you on the pod for the first time. I'm sure this is the first among many.
