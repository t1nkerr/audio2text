Andrew Polk:
for talking, both of you. I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market, and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to sort of joint people onto a better path. And our thesis was kind of like, well, the government will have to do it. It'll have to do it at the third plenum, which happened last year, to do it at the two sessions. And it kept feeling like the government like was missing these opportunities, but then here, you know, the private sector, the Deep Seek thing comes, and maybe it seems like, you know, we'll wait to see it's only been, you know, a month and a half or so. But maybe that was the catalyst that they needed and then, I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, you know what, from that Deep Seek development, like you said, how important AI is and how we now have a path towards putting it into government policy, supporting it the government policy. And we see now a path for we see recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. And so, it turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the, you know, purview or really even expectation of the Chinese government and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ethan Yin:
Yeah. And and not to over use that. But I do think, you know, if you kind of remember last year, you know, things are great in Q1 and I think the thing started to kind of go bad in Q2. I do want to say there's a few things here. Second, it depends on whether, you know, Trump decided to tighten the screw in China again, you know, significantly increase tariffs. I think that does have significant impact of that. And I think more importantly is, if that happens, we or the policy makers do as they say, which is deploy additional policy support in a very timely manner. Because if that happens again, I can see this kind of fragile kind of confidence kind of building up, kind of go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. So 100%. This is not the slam dunk that we are now on a new path. But this is our business. We watch this stuff closely, if we try to see kind of if we are on the new trajectory. But speak that's a great, actually perfect pivot point. Speaking of Trump and potentially new tariffs, this kind of constant will they won't they reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet and again, like I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast to try to think about China's perspective on things and here and not make it all about US China, but with the CDF and kind of this context this week, you know, I think this is particularly relevant. Diving into, you know, the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. And so just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC and they were expressing to me a point that I thought was made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we were talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea. But just so you know, like our normal operating procedure is to have working level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth, then we kick that up to the next level after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out, to the next higher level, maybe it's the ministerial/you know, cabinet level. Those people work out. Then we go up to the next level, which might be the the senior leaders, the heads of state. They meet, it's pretty much just kind of pro forma. They're just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That's how we like to operate, right? And I was like, well, those working level meetings don't seem like they're happening. They're like, no, they're they're not happening. And but obviously, Donald Trump, and so first of all, those working level meetings, like I said, aren't happening. I think maybe not obviously. But Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the head of state and basically have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, sort things out and then go top down instead of bottom up, have everybody below them, then work out the details of how to get things done. So I guess, let me bring in Joe again here and then we'll bring you in again Ethan, you think that's the right read on the situation, Joe, and secondly, I mean, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, I think that absolutely tracks as I mean, I I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol conscious, no matter where they're from and I think that's especially true in in the Chinese system where just the political, you know, politics is very choreographed in most respects. And beyond just sort of the simple, you know, questions of protocol, I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time obviously, in US China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. So, we're talking about optics, right? There was there was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that's the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You're going to not only, you know, Trump's home turf in terms of being in the states, but his literal home turf. Yeah, you know, there were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because that a lot more of the protocol is then then in their hands and play the gracious host. And there've been another number of other kind of suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I'm now kind of of the opinion, I don't think one is imminent. It doesn't mean one won't happen, but I think that the Chinese side as you mentioned is very nervous about I suppose the very ad hoc way that that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. And that sort of brings me to the second point, which is outcomes, right? So beyond the optics of of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that he was not aware of or didn't agree to or anything like that. There's a lot riding on this meeting. Right? I mean, Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Bessent to the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the phase one trade deal from way back in 2020. So I mean, if it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US China trade and economic tension. Right? That equally, if it goes badly, I mean, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work and if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think grow increasingly dim and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain or at least agreeing to work toward something that'll help to satisfy both sides, that that reduces dramatically, right? And the fact that working level groups have apparently stalled out, mean that it's going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it's really important that both sides get this right. And if they don't, I mean, I think it could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side doesn't want to see and ultimately would would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ethan Yin:
Yeah, I totally agree with you both. Uh, I think I I just want to kind of try and do think through because, you know, our job is trying to be forward looking. As you kind of talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. And I think what could happen is actually, you know, Andrew, you kind of mentioned that Trump prefer kind of top down kind of approach, and for the Chinese, they kind of prefer kind of bottom up. And I think the possible way out is probably start from someone kind of at middle level, which is, you know, both leaders appoint a deputy who is kind of in charge of this and they can hash things out. And if we look at back to Trump 1.0, it's basically Lighthizer hashed out a deal with Liu He, right? So far, we haven't seen that level kind of very productive engagement at that level. I think Vice Premier He Lifeng had one call with the counterpart in the state side, but not much kind of engagement so far. But I think it still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that kind of process. It's basically they hop up on the call saying, hey, you know, this deal is is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it. I think if one thing...

Andrew Polk:
Can I ask you for, yeah, go ahead.

Ethan Yin:
Yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Polk:
I was just going to ask you, so, I mean, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ethan Yin:
He Lifeng.

Andrew Polk:
I'm struggling on the US side to think who it would be partly because I just like I said, I think Donald Trump wants to take the lead and isn't quite inclined to back any of his cabinet secretaries to necessarily believe that I basically don't think he trusts them to take that over. Did just my reading of it so far. Obviously, he deans the the senator that we talked about from Montana's trying to sort of make a play to become an envoy. So I mean, I'll just leave that US side aside for now because that it's not quite clear to me who that would be, but my question for you is, who do you think it would be on the Chinese side?

Ethan Yin:
You know, it would be Vice Premier He Lifeng. He has a portfolio. US China commercial relation is under him and also he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. So he is a perfect person.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Yeah, great.

Ethan Yin:
And he is a very savvy operative, very good at kind of enforcing whatever Xi Jinping wants.

Andrew Polk:
And so he's in lockstep with Xi and knows

Ethan Yin:
Yes.

Andrew Polk:
sort of speak for.

Ethan Yin:
Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
And I think that's the challenge on the US side is like, it's not exactly clear, quote, who speaks for Donald Trump. Okay, so that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geopolitical kind of moment that we're in that's sort of shaping the context for that. And we'll see what happens with this potential Trump-Xi meeting. But in the meantime, I want to talk about the last thing that we have on our list today, which we've been tracking closely, which is China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic lawfare, in terms of how they're choosing to hit back against US tariffs and export controls, et cetera. So this week we had a pretty big new development on this front with the State Council issuing new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. As a reminder, China passed the anti-foreign sanctions law or AFSL in 2021 as part of a larger effort to build a legal framework to strike back against foreign economic coercion, particularly from the US. And so these new regulations strengthen the enforceability of China's existing counter-sanctions toolkit by clarifying the law's scope and prohibited activities. Specifically, the regulations stipulate that, quote, any foreign country, organization or individual that implements, assists or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security and development interests, in quote, is liable to be sanctioned. And so they also lay out specific punishments if you you are sanctioned or listed under the anti-foreign sanctions law, there's a list of punishments and then finally, these regulations specify a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement. So Joe, let me bring you back in or throw this over to you. You know, we've got these bevy of foreign executives in Beijing, and Beijing's saying, hey, we're open for business, come invest. During that meeting, they implement these regul or release these regulations that say, oh, by the way, here's how we can punish foreign companies if they comply with US or European sanctions. So what's going on here? What do we make of it?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose the overall message that China wants to send, putting it all together, is that yes, we are open for business. We welcome you to participate in China's development and we will continue opening and providing you a better business environment. But if you try to harm our economic interests or basically carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, then we have the power to strike back. And in perfect fairness, I mean, this is sort of the implication that underlines business in any country, right? Is no country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as as harming its its national security, right? But I mean, what I would say is that yes, I think there is sort of an inherent contradiction there, but I think it's also an effort to sort of clarify or give a little bit of clarity to foreign companies about, you know, where the red lines are and what's at stake. Right? So I think, you know, a criticism about China treatment of foreign companies in the past has been, well, it's it's random, it's opaque, you never know if you're going to be on the chopping block. And I think that China's really keen to sort of move away from that narrative or to counteract that narrative by saying, look, here are the specific things that will get you in trouble. Here are the specific penalties that you can expect to face, and these are the specific organizations that are going to be carrying it out, right? I think that's the the message that China wants to send. I don't know if that's going to be received as such by foreign companies because you're right. I mean, it does on the face of it seem a little bit contradictory, but I think the point here is that China wants to make it clear to foreign companies that you are welcome to do business in China so long as you follow the rules and these are what those rules are.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah, great points, great points. Ether, your thoughts on this on the regs from the council on the ASFL?

Ethan Yin:
No, I think my point would be, I think Chinese policy makers have shown this kind of consistently for past two years is that they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress on that. And this regulation is just one of that and I'm sure we'll see more, you know, next. My point there is that I think the Chinese policy makers kind of intention with this thing is not to use those tools at the first place. This is purely for, you know, if US has put out either kind of sanctions or tariffs and hurting Chinese economy and industries, they will use these tools to retaliate. I think when they kind of view it from that lens, you know, they view it as we are doing kind of self-defense. And unfortunately, foreign companies becomes the collateral damage of that.

Andrew Polk:
Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. So what strikes me, we've been covering all the what we call, you know, economic coercion toolkit or the lawfare toolkit, the Chinese has been building up for several years now. We've been covering it very closely since 2018. Basically, this is one of the big things we've been waiting for because we've been telling our clients like, hey, they can't really use the ASFL. It's not ready for prime time because they haven't done some of the detailed work to make sure that they know which agencies in charge of which aspects of the punishments. And these regs, they address that issue, right? And so, I mean, it's a very clear signal to me that the AFL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time and that it will be used, as you said, as retaliation and not, I think, proactively necessarily to punish foreign companies to try to get them to do China's bidding just in general, but even use as a reactionary or retaliatory tool. I mean, it just puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions for tat back and forth. I mean, what do you do if you're a business?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, so I would add to that is yeah, I mean, I do think that this is probably a prelude to them to these regulations being used more extensively. And just if you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach is like, yes, there have been some counter tariffs, but much more targeted compared with the blanket US tariffs. And I think a bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. And so yes, obviously that's going to be something that spooks foreign companies and particularly US companies. However, the companies that I'm thinking of in question, so PVH Group and Illumina, there was also a fairly direct political tie-in where they had both done things that were seen as kind of directly infringing on China's interests. So in PVH that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains and in the case of Illumina, that was lobbying sort of against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. So I think it's not just going to be China pulling names of random US companies out of a hat and saying, oh, bad luck. I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to and say, yeah, you actively sought to harm our our development interests. So now you're going on the list. So I mean, that may or may not be comforting at all to US companies because it's possible that, you know, these these are these are possibly things that will be applied ex post facto. It's because they did something, you know, a few years ago that China didn't like and for that reason they end up as part of the next round of retaliation. But yeah, I mean, it will be primarily defensive. It won't be particularly random. I think there will almost always be a political tie-in.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, let me just make one observation before I throw it to you for the last word either, is I'll just say Joe, that's a good point. And also, in both the case of PVH and Illumina, which they weren't put on the ASFL, but were put on the unreliable entities list, the punishment, as far as I know, there still has been no specific announced punishment for PVH. And then for Illumina, the punishment was sort of just like you can't import certain gene sequencers into China, but you can still make those gene sequencers inside China where they have a big footprint. So a pretty kind of slap on the wrist punishment. All that is to say, I do think they're going to use it more proactively, but I think they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here. So I just want to add that on to what you said Joe, and then Ethan, you know, what do you think?

Joe Mazur:
And sorry, one more quick thing is it's a deterrent, right? The idea it's it's hopefully, it's the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on earth and say, oh, man, we really got to be careful about this and to kind of reassess their operations to say that are we doing anything that could run us a foul of these regulations. So I think first and foremost, well, I mean it is the defensive tool, but also it's it's hopefully one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books. I'm I'm sure it will get used more extensively, but I think that that's sort of a secondary purpose of these regulations.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, the bow can.

Ethan Yin:
Go ahead, Andrew.

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead Ethan.

Ethan Yin:
I want to add points. You both kind of made is that I think for multinational companies, the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously is an important point to remember. I think that cautiousness will be reflected reflected on two fronts. I think on one, on the first one, what we will see is that if you kind of look at all the companies been put on, you know, EUL or other kind of list, I can see they are trying to basically outlining the Chinese government kind of red lines by singling out one company who is doing very badly on that. You know, if you look at PVH, it's about Xinjiang. If you look at Illumina, it's about, you know, biotech. I think, you know, the next one was looking at if is if they're going to do anything with US chip industry. I mean, they already put Nvidia open the the monopoly fine investigation on Nvidia. I think they buy by singling out those company, they're basically showing to the world here are a few kind of red line issues for us. You know, that's one thing. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. So it's for each issue, we set an example. I think that's kind of their approach. And the second one, I think exactly your point Andrew about there's, you know, maybe with exception of Illumina, there's no punishment. I think it's still our view that the end goal here is that they are preparing, the Chinese has been preparing for getting back to the table with Trump and to negotiate a deal. And when both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage you have or bargaining chips you have, right? For for Trump, there's a lot of kind of chips because over the past few years, there are so many tariffs, there are so many sanctions, so many companies, Chinese companies are on on the sanction list. But if you look at Chinese companies, they don't have much kind of bargaining chips. So they've been kind of announcing those investigations without kind of announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargaining chips. You know, if you remove certain Chinese company of your list, I'll remove those US company of my list, right? So I think that's kind of the thing they've been trying to prepare.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a great point. Great point. And I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground and just another quick plug, like we'll be watching all of this stuff, especially on the sanctions and export controls and lawfare side very closely, and we help foreign, you know, non-Chinese companies and investors figure this stuff out and navigate it. You know, if you have an issue with this stuff, or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at HQ@triviumchina.com. We'd love to work with you. But in the meantime, let's wrap it up there. Guys, Joe, Ethan, so great to have you on the pod for the first time. I'm sure this is the first among many. So thanks to you both for being here.

Ethan Yin:
Yeah.

Joe Mazur:
All right, thanks, everyone. Good having this conversation with you guys. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Absolutely. And after this, we can go grab some drinks together and hang out. All right, guys. Y'all take care. Thanks everybody for joining us and listening. And we'll see you next time. Bye everybody.

Ethan Yin:
Bye, everyone.
