Ether Yin:
about the China economy. We have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say, "We're willing to stimulate more. We've got a bunch of tools in our toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape, and we're going to accelerate our policy support."

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. If you look at all the Chamber of Commerce surveys, last year, across all Chambers of Commerce, the top two issues for multinational companies were the economy and geopolitical tension. I think last year, the top concern was actually the Chinese economy, and the second one was geopolitical tension. I think that order switched this year when Trump came to power. For most multinational companies, geopolitics is the top concern, but the economy is still the second concern. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF; I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. I talked to a ton of senior business executives, some of our clients, and the mood was actually pretty upbeat despite the economy being pretty bad. So this was spring 2024. I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives had been to China since the pandemic started. So they had the COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then in 2023, people were sort of sending lower-level executives through, trying to get their feet back into the China market. Then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was a lot of positive energy around these business people finally being back in China. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on it a little bit. And then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying, "We've got the economy back; we know the issues." But does anybody believe it? Truly, where are businesses' heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. In terms of the business vibe, for Chinese businesses, and even among the public, the sentiment started to improve right after Chinese New Year; it's getting warmed up.

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025, so February 2025.

Ether Yin:
Yes. I think the biggest thing that happened there is that over the Chinese New Year, if you all remember, DeepSeek overnight became a global headline. It tanked the US stock market, even temporarily, but it still made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to both public sentiment and business sentiment, particularly Chinese business sentiment, is that over the past few years, there's been this narrative or sense that China's economy or industries are being suppressed by the US, both government sanctions and US businesses. But just because of DeepSeek, everyone feels like they've made a breakthrough. We can argue whether or not that's true and to what extent that's true, but it still gives people a boost of confidence that they can do this. The industry, the economy, can make a breakthrough in that containment or suppression, whatever. Then you have all the businesses, manufacturing, everyone wants to figure out how they can integrate into this AI thing. I think, visibly, in Premier Li's government work report during the Two Sessions, they didn't explicitly say it, but we can see some signs that because of DeepSeek, they even changed some language in the government work report, because some of the AI initiatives wouldn't be possible without DeepSeek's success. That's big and huge. And then that also leads to, I think, global investors reevaluating the Chinese stock market, and the price is going up. A lot of folks here have investments in that, which also helps to boost sentiment. And then that leads to the March Two Sessions. I would say nothing was unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which basically told the public and the industry here that, "Okay, the government will keep its promise that the economic policy is going to be very supportive this year." So, I think that kind of changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I want to bring Joe in here because the reason I say that's huge is, I've just said I was in Beijing around the time of, or during the time of, the CDF 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was sort of optimism just because it was the first time these senior executives had been in China. They felt like they were re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled, and over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024, I was in China during both of those periods, and it became evident at that point, sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses and domestic individuals, it's all anybody would talk about. Housing markets are still under wraps. People don't want to spend money, it's just things are not good. So hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months that's really starting to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've lived in China for what, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in sentiment as well, just among yourself as a consumer in China, your network of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on all that?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with a gap of several months, you are in some ways better positioned to say, "Oh, this is different from the last time I was here." Whereas for me, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot. You kind of don't realize the change until all of a sudden. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether, kind of just on an anecdotal level. Last year, my friends in Beijing experienced a kind of doom and gloom. Young Chinese people were saying to me, "My parents pressured me into buying a house, but now its value is underwater, and I kind of feel like I regret it." I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators: I see fewer closed storefronts, which I think has been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well. And I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there in that the weather is starting to get nice, maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, and I mean, I think that there have been a number of developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about DeepSeek. But I also think events in the US, by comparison, people in China maybe feel like they're not so bad off. So, I mean, you're certainly reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even the thing like the She-Hong-Shu phenomenon, where it was the first time possibly ever where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on a large scale. I think, whether or not they gained a fully accurate picture of one another, I think the narrative that emerged from that for Chinese people was like, "Oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China. And there are a lot of aspects about the US which are, you know, quite troubling." Again, I mean, we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given the information ecosystems are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, "Well, things are not great, but they could be worse," right? I mean, I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. So, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it's like a massive night-and-day shift, but it's certainly just as a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as an economic indicator. It does seem somewhat better than in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. Joe made a great point. I think the other aspect here, or contributing factor, is that the Chinese are overprepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone was expecting a second term to be very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still not great, but still better than expected. And also, on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's been the US against China, because it seems like the US family is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like, it's the US against the world. Everyone suffers, it's not just us, that also kind of helps you to improve how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean, that's really interesting because just as you guys were talking, both of you, I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about the lack of consumer confidence, the weak
