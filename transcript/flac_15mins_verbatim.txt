Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China Podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai, and I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. Feel excited about, you know, joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're gonna have a good discussion. Yeah. And then we're also delighted to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing but also in Shanghai today, that's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazer:
Thanks. I'm doing good, Andrew. A long time listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because, you know, I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst and Ether, being our, well, overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on kind of the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss, you know, the wider thinking of the business community in China as well as how consumers are feeling sort of against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, last thing we'll touch on is kind of the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's a particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, you know, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazer:
Yeah, the the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also, I mean, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, you know, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to sort of the China business environment, whether that's domestic, Chinese companies, foreign MNCs, doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think, you know, first of all, kind of life is great. Almost kind of half my life is work, which is this company. I think we're doing great, you know, also have you guys coming in Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great. Nothing to complain. If we talk about kind of like how's kind of vibe, general vibe in regard to the China business environment. I think that's gets to kind of interesting, because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think, you know, if we are talking about kind of Chinese kind of private business, I think the vibe there is actually kind of going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about kind of like why, what happened, kind of later. But I think if we're talking about kind of foreign business, it's probably kind of in a different track. I think there are something kind of improvement, improved for them. I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also, you know, I think on just in general, kind of external challenges they're facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that put them. I think in general, they are compared to Chinese kind of private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing, just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems, is kind of what I say. Small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face to face with our colleagues, and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So, thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the meat of the discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes, as usual.

So, all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days, so we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd or 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So it's been held annually since the year 2000. Um, the CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, you know, talking about the economy. It's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier, talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to the meeting with the premier. The meeting with the premier is usually kind of the highlight for these executives. But yeah, kind of giving that background. Oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin:
No, I just want to kind of point out. I think if you kind of look at kind of that kind of premier's kind of meetings with business, it's still, I I could kind of argue for some business, some foreign business, still kind of disappointing because now kind of whole setting is kind of primarily focused on US business and I think the the meeting of the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So you can also argument, you can still argue, you know, that kind of meeting is not kind of inclusive enough to address the kind of whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. And the geopolitics obviously, in the US-China specifically relationship, hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your homestate, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazer:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation, trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well. So don't want to jump too far ahead, but it's kind of is all about the US business community and the European business community, and the Asian community are kind of like, well, WCF. How do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what it was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, you know, from his, what is the senior government or senior government officials on the Chinese side, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, you know, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here?

Joe Mazer:
Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is, you know, a fairly rare opportunity in in most cases. It's also it's opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So just for all those reasons, it's sort of an event not to be missed and really have drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. Um, it's also a chance to show that, you know, we're in China for China and they kind of express their commitment to the China market. That's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and just about, you know, Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important. It's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. So that's that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question. You know, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions at least for, I mean, decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working? Or is business heard from your perspective in, I mean, other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular. Is it, are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a stronger voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazer:
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a brave new world, especially in the in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I mean, yeah, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, you know, hey, think about it. You you've you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it it it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, yeah, certainly in the past, companies and and trade bodies have played a role in in influencing the trajectory of of US-China policy and and China's relationship with other countries. So now I think, you know, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are sort of two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and and negative. Sort of in the the lead up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in, I think it was November. There was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to kind of win over votes to their side on that. And ultimately those tariffs did go through, but I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to the sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. I mean, my immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser focused on the trade deficit and and sort of this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But I mean, I certainly it doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the the Trump administration, sort of maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminous goals with China. Well, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China. Yeah, I mean, that's a

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I think that's actually a very interesting question. And actually, I want to kind of ask you guys about, I think in particular, Andrew, you, because, you know, most of the time you're based in DC. So you are very familiar with kind of the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compare kind of Trump and Biden on the Trump administration, there's kind of more room for US business to influence
