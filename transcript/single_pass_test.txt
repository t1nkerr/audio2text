[00:11] Andrew Polk: Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. I am really glad to be joined by two guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. We'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

[00:36] Ether Yin: Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. I feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

[00:43] Andrew Polk: It's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. We are also delighted to have our Head of Geopolitical Research, who is usually based in Beijing but is also in Shanghai today, Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

[00:57] Joe Mazur: Thanks. I'm doing good, Andrew. A long-time listener, first-time caller.

[01:05] Andrew Polk: It's great to have both of you guys on, not only because I don't get to see you very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome, but also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week: the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF. This is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. With Joe being our lead geopolitical analyst and Ether being our overall policy guru who is deep into our research on the business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion.

[01:50] Andrew Polk: We'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. Thirdly, we'll touch on the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.

[02:22] Andrew Polk: Before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside versus when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing. Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast in the last week of March?

[02:46] Joe Mazur: The vibes are good. Just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai and seeing some colleagues I don't often get to see, the weather is very nice. On the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

[03:01] Andrew Polk: That's a very positive spin. A lot of people keep hearing the word "overwhelming." Kendra on the pod the other day said we're at turbo speed. You're very much in line with everybody else. Ether, how is your vibe and life in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies or foreign MNCs doing business in China?

[03:34] Ether Yin: Life is great. Almost half of my life is work with this company, and I think we're doing great. Having you guys in Shanghai makes me feel super happy. Regarding the general vibe for the China business environment, I think it gets interesting. I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later, but overall, if we are talking about Chinese private business, the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. If we are talking about foreign business, it is probably on a different track. There is some improvement for them on the domestic front, but the external challenges they are facing now have multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on net, compared to Chinese private business, they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

[04:51] Andrew Polk: We'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses are feeling better and why foreign multinationals in China have these ups and downs. On my vibe, I feel the same as you. I was on the podcast yesterday and told everyone I was coming here to Shanghai. Now I'm here seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down, so that's amazing. To show people behind the curtain on how Trivium works, we're a small company, but we have multinational problems. We very rarely get to be face-to-face with our colleagues, so it's been really great to have everyone here.

[06:47] Andrew Polk: All right, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days. We're recording on Wednesday, March 26th. It was Monday and Tuesday, the 23rd and 24th. The CDF has been held annually since the year 2000. It is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended. US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights is typically a speech from the Premier talking up the economy and how welcome foreign businesses are. That was again the case this year with Li Qiang. The Premier usually meets with foreign business leaders, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meetings, which was disappointing for folks who had come all the way to meet him.

[08:05] Ether Yin: I want to point out that if you look at those meetings with business, it was still a bit disappointing because the whole setting was primarily focused on US business. The meeting with the US delegation was led by the Republican Senator Steve Daines. You could argue that meeting was not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

[08:42] Andrew Polk: That's a good point. The US-China relationship specifically hangs over everything. Steve Daines is from your home state of Montana, Joe?

[08:52] Joe Mazur: He is from the great state of Montana.

[08:54] Andrew Polk: He's here with a delegation trying to potentially lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into. Ether, your point is that it was similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met only with US businesses. It underlines the point that geopolitics hang heavy over everything. Joe, what was the message you got from Li Qiang and the senior government officials on the Chinese side? What message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders?

[09:56] Joe Mazur: If it's not obvious, the CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a rare opportunity. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to discuss with their fellow titans of industry how they feel about the China market. It's also a chance to show that they're in China for China and to express their commitment.

[10:41] Joe Mazur: In terms of the messaging, in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. If you follow these meetings, you'll be familiar with the talking points: China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development, we're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. There's also a piece which we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism. The hope is that these companies, as beneficiaries of China's opening and globalization, will exert some kind of influence on their home governments regarding trade deficits and security concerns to say the trade relationship is worth preserving.

[12:05] Andrew Polk: The Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions for decades. It used to work. Is it still working? Is business heard in DC and Brussels, or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree?

[12:33] Joe Mazur: It's a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. Certainly, it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. In the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy. Now, we talk about US-China versus EU-China as two different things. In the case of the EU, this sort of business pressure does work, both positively and negatively. In the lead-up to the EU's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs back in November, there was a lot of politicking happening, and China was exerting pressure in terms of inducements and threats to win over votes. For the US side, I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. They are laser-focused on the trade deficit and this America First economic policy. But it doesn't hurt to try. Maybe if you have a high-profile CEO like Tim Cook lobbying with co-terminus goals, that would be enough to get the US to at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

[14:32] Ether Yin: I want to ask you, Andrew, because you are based in DC most of the time. Compared to Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, is there more room for US business to influence policy? My understanding with Biden is that his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. When US businesses have conversations trying to influence policy, once it reaches a national security matter, that's the end of the conversation. With Trump, it's more like there are no principles or not many red lines. Is there more room for US business to influence his policies?

[15:42] Andrew Polk: The business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. That's when you started hearing Trump administration officials saying, "Your companies are part of the problem. You helped create this issue of a trade surplus from China by outsourcing production there." That mentality was maintained throughout the Biden administration. Now, in a second Trump administration, it's a bit too early to tell, but we definitely see US businesses trying to get on Trump's good side. They're dropping their DEI policies and the tech companies are donating to the inauguration. I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say because companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to work with a second Trump administration.

[17:48] Ether Yin: That helps reinforce our understanding of whether Premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to resist protectionism is going to work. I don't think it will because multinational companies are facing increasing pressure from their home governments and the public to bring jobs and production back. The other thing on the messages the Premier wanted to send at the CDF is on the domestic front. It's trying to assure foreign companies the government has the back of the economy. We already saw that during the Two Sessions in March when the government announced aggressive fiscal policies. The other key message Li Qiang tried to bring home is that everyone knows things can get worse later this year if Trump dramatically increases tariffs on China. The policymakers have thought about that and already have a plan. This time we'll be better prepared. Before that even happens, we will release additional policies not included at the Two Sessions. They're trying to send that message loudly and clearly to assure everyone that if you're worried about the Chinese economy, we have a plan to deal with that.

[19:57] Andrew Polk: They're trying to say they are willing to stimulate more and they have a lot of dry powder. They understand the economy is not in the best shape and they're going to accelerate policy support.

[20:15] Ether Yin: If you look at foreign chambers of commerce surveys last year, across chambers, the top two issues for multinational companies were the economy and geopolitical tension. Last year, the top concern was actually the economy, and the second was geopolitical tension. I think that order switched over this year when Trump came to power. Geopolitics is the top concern, but the economy is still the second concern. They are just trying to address those concerns.

[21:11] Andrew Polk: I talked to a ton of senior business executives last year. The mood was actually pretty upbeat in Spring 2024. It was the first time a lot of these executives had been to China since the pandemic started. There was a lot of positive energy around finally being back. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. What is your sense among businesses, both domestic and foreign? Does anybody believe the government has the economy's back?

[22:23] Ether Yin: In terms of business vibes, right after Chinese New Year 2025 in February, the sentiment started to improve. The big thing that happened there was DeepSeek. It became a headline globally and tanked the US stock market, even if only temporarily. What that does to public and business sentiment in China is that over the past few years, you've been under this sense that China's economy and industry are being suppressed by the US through sanctions. But because of DeepSeek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue whether that's true and to what extent, but it gave people a boost of confidence that we can do this. Everyone wants to figure out how they can integrate into this AI thing. In the Government Work Report during the Two Sessions, they even changed some language because some of the AI initiatives wouldn't be possible without DeepSeek's success. That also leads to global investors' revaluation of the Chinese stock market. The price going up helps boost sentiment. In the March Two Sessions, nothing was unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing. The government will keep their promise that economic policy is going to be very supportive this year.

[25:11] Andrew Polk: Joe, you've lived in China for ten years. Have you seen a change in sentiment as a consumer and within your network of Chinese and foreign individuals?

[26:30] Joe Mazur: It's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot; you don't realize the change until all of a sudden you do. Having said that, I tend to agree with Ether. Last year, it was doom and gloom. Young Chinese people were saying their parents pressured them into buying a house, and now it's underwater in terms of price. I hear less of that now. I see fewer closed storefronts, which was a noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID. People seem to be getting out a lot more as the weather gets nice. Events in the US make people in China feel like they're not so bad off. They're reading about economic hardship in America. Even something like the TikTok phenomenon where you had young Chinese and Americans interacting—the narrative that emerged was, "Oh wow, it's really not so bad living in China," and that there are aspects about the US which are quite troubling. I wouldn't say it's a massive night-and-day shift, but the overall vibe does seem somewhat better than in the past year.

[29:00] Ether Yin: I think the other contributing factor is that the Chinese are over-prepared for the Trump administration. Everyone is expecting the second term will be very hard. As of now, it's still not great, but better than expected. Also, over the past few years, it's been the US against China, but now it's like the US against the world. Everyone suffers, not just us. That also helps you feel a little better.

[29:46] Andrew Polk: For several years now, we've talked about the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, and the struggling real estate market. We thought the government needed a catalyst to change the narrative. It kept feeling like the government was missing these opportunities at the Third Plenum or the Two Sessions. But then the private sector DeepSeek development comes, and maybe that was the catalyst they needed. The government has really ridden the wake of that and recognizes the role of the private sector in accomplishing tech goals.

[31:22] Ether Yin: I do want to say things were great in Q1 last year and started to go bad in Q2. It depends on whether Trump decides to tighten the screw on China again with tariffs. If that happens, this fragile confidence could go away very quickly.

[32:16] Andrew Polk: Speaking of Trump and new tariffs, there is constant "will they, won't they" reporting around whether Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet. Before I came over here, I had some meetings with Chinese officials in DC. They were expressing a point that made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Our normal operating procedure is to have working-level meetings that iron out a lot of details, then kick that up to the ministerial level, then finally to the heads of state where it's pro-forma. Those working-level meetings aren't happening right now. Donald Trump clearly wants to start at the head of state level, have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, sort things out, and then go top-down. Joe, is that the right read on the situation?

[34:22] Joe Mazur: That absolutely tracks. Diplomats are very protocol-conscious, especially in the Chinese system where politics is very choreographed. This is coming at an extremely delicate time in US-China relations. In terms of optics, there was a report suggesting the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago. That makes Xi look like a supplicant, going to Trump's literal home turf. There were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because they can play the gracious host. I don't think a meeting is imminent. The Chinese side is very nervous about the ad hoc way that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. Trump has repeatedly said he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping and would like to strike some kind of deal. If it goes well, you could see a stabilization of some of the big issues at the heart of trade and economic tension. Equally, if it goes badly, you really only have this one shot to make it work. The fact that working-level groups have stalled out means it's really going to require the impetus of the two leaders. It's really important that both sides get this right.

[37:21] Ether Yin: The best way out is probably starting at the middle level, where both leaders appoint a deputy in charge of this to hash things out. In Trump 1.0, it was Lighthizer hashing out a deal with Liu He. So far, we haven't seen that level of productive engagement. Vice Premier He Lifeng had one call, but not much engagement so far. It still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that process.

[38:43] Andrew Polk: Who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

[38:47] Ether Yin: It would be Vice Premier He Lifeng. He has the portfolio for US-China commercial relations, and he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. He is a very savvy operative and is in lockstep with Xi.

[39:48] Andrew Polk: That's a great discussion on the CDF and the geopolitical moment. In the meantime, I want to talk about the last thing on our list: China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic lawfare. This week, the State Council issued new regulations to beef up China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (AFSL), which was passed in 2021 to strike back against foreign economic coercion. These new regulations strengthen the enforceability of the existing toolkit by clarifying the law's scope. Specifically, the regulations stipulate that any foreign country, organization, or individual that implements, assists, or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development interests is liable to be sanctioned. They also lay out specific punishments and a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement. Joe, we've got these foreign executives in Beijing, and Beijing is saying, "We're open for business," while also releasing these regulations. What do we make of this?

[41:52] Joe Mazur: The overall message that China wants to send is: Yes, we are open for business, but if you try to harm our economic interests or carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, we have the power to strike back. No country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as harming its national security. I think it's also an effort to give some clarity to foreign companies about where the red lines are and what's at stake. A criticism in the past has been that China's treatment of foreign companies is random and opaque. China is keen to counteract that narrative by saying, "Here are the specific things that will get you in trouble, here are the penalties, and these are the organizations carrying it out." China wants to make it clear that you are welcome to do business so long as you follow the rules.

[43:31] Ether Yin: Chinese policymakers have shown consistently for the past two years that they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress, and this regulation is just one of those. I think the Chinese policymakers' intention is not to use those tools in the first place. This is purely for retaliation if the US puts out sanctions or tariffs. They view it as self-defense. Unfortunately, foreign companies become the collateral damage of that.

[44:39] Andrew Polk: We've been telling our clients that they couldn't really use the AFSL because they hadn't done some of the detailed work to ensure which agency is in charge. These regs address that issue. It's a very clear signal to me that the AFSL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time. It puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions tit-for-tat.

[45:48] Joe Mazur: If you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach. Yes, there have been some counter-tariffs, but much more targeted. A bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. Obviously, that's going to spook foreign companies, particularly US companies. However, for the companies in question—PVH Group and Illumina—there was also a fairly direct political tie-in. In PVH, that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains. In the case of Illumina, it was lobbying against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to. It will be primarily defensive.

[47:26] Andrew Polk: That's a good point. Also, in both the case of PVH and Illumina, they weren't put on the AFSL but were put on the Unreliable Entities List. The punishment, as far as I know, still has had no specific announcement for PVH. For Illumina, the punishment was just that you can't import certain gene sequencers into China, but you can still make them inside China where they have a big footprint. So, a pretty slap-on-the-wrist punishment. I think they will use it more proactively, but they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here.

[48:19] Joe Mazur: It's a deterrent. It's hopefully the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on notice to reassess their operations. First and foremost, it is the defensive tool, but also one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books.

[48:54] Ether Yin: I think the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously. That cautiousness will be reflected on two fronts. First, they are trying to outline the Chinese government's red lines by singling out one company that is doing very badly on that. With PVH, it's about Xinjiang. With Illumina, it's about biotech. The next one worth looking at is the US chip industry, as they already opened the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. They are showing the world several red-line issues for us. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. For each issue, they set an example. Second, the end goal here is that the Chinese are preparing for getting back to the table with Trump to negotiate a deal. When both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage or bargaining chips do you have? For Trump, there are a lot of chips because of tariffs and sanctions. Chinese companies don't have much bargaining leverage. So they've been announcing those investigations without announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargaining chips. If you remove certain Chinese companies from your list, I'll remove those US companies from my list.

[51:11] Andrew Polk: That's a great point. I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground. We'll be watching all of this stuff, especially on the sanctions and export controls side, very closely. If you have an issue with this stuff or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at hq@triviumchina.com. Joe, Ether, so great to have you on the podcast. I'm sure this is the first among many. Thanks to you both for being here.

[51:57] Joe Mazur: All right, thanks everyone.

[52:00] Ether Yin: Good having this conversation with you guys.

[52:03] Andrew Polk: Absolutely. After this, we can go grab some drinks together and hang out. All right guys, y'all take care. Thanks everybody for joining us and listening, and we'll see you next time. Bye everybody.

[52:17] Ether Yin: Bye everyone.
