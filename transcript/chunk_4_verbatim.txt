Andrew Polk:
I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market, and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to sort of joint people onto a better path. And our thesis was kind of like, well, the government will have to do it. It'll have to do it at the third plenum, which happened last year, or they'll do it at the two sessions. And it kept feeling like the government like was missing these opportunities, but then here, you know, the private sector, the deep seek thing comes, and maybe it seems like, you know, we'll wait to see, it's only been, you know, a month and a half or so, but maybe that was the catalyst that they needed, and then I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, you know what, from that deep seek development, like you said, how important AI is, and how we now have a path towards putting it into government policy, supporting at the government policy. And we see now a path for we see recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. And so it turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the, you know, purview or really even expectation of the Chinese government, and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ether Yin:
Yeah. And and not to over use that. But I do think, you know, if you kind of remember last year, you know, things are great in Q1 and I think the thing started to kind of go bad in Q2. I do want to say there's a few things here. Second, it depends on whether, you know, Trump decided to tighten the screw in China again, you know, significantly increase tariffs. I think that does have significant impact of that. And I think more importantly is if that happens, we or the policy makers do as they say, which is deploy additional policy supporting a very timely manner, because if that happens again, I can see this kind of fragile, kind of confidence, kind of building up, going to go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. So 100%. It is not the slam dunk that we are now on a new path. Well, this is our business. We watch this stuff closely, if we try to see kind of if we are on the new trajectory. But speaking of that's a good actually perfect pivot point, speaking of Trump and potentially in Xi, this kind of constant will they won't they reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet. And again, like I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast is to try to think about China's perspective on things. And here, and not make it all about US-China, but with the CDF and kind of this context this week, you know, I think this is particularly relevant. Diving into, you know, the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. And so just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC, and they were expressing to me a point that I thought was made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we were talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea. But just so you know, like our normal operating procedure is to have working level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth, then we kick that up to the next level, after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out to the next higher level, maybe it's the ministerial/ you know, cabinet level. Those people work out. Then we go up to the next level, which might be the the senior leaders, the heads of state. They meet, it's pretty much just kind of pro forma. They're just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That's how we like to operate, right? And I was like, well, those working level meetings don't seem like they're happening. They're like, no, they're not happening. And but obviously, Donald Trump, and so first of all those working level meetings, like I said, aren't happening. I think maybe not obviously. But Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the head of state and basically have one on one with Xi Jinping, sort things out and then go top down instead of bottom up. Have everybody below them then work out the details of how to get things done. So I guess let me bring in Joe again here and then we'll bring you in again either. Do you think that's the right read on the situation, Joe? And secondly, I mean, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that absolutely tracks as I mean, I I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol conscious no matter where they're from and I think that's especially true in in the Chinese system where just the political, you know, politics is very choreographed in most respects. And beyond just sort of the simple, you know, questions of protocol. I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time, obviously in US-China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. So, you know, we're talking about optics, right? There was there was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that's the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You're going to not only, you know, Trump's home turf in terms of being in the states, but his literal home turf. Yeah, there were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to because that a lot more of the protocol is then then in their hands, and they played the gracious host. And there have been another number of other kind of suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I'm now kind of of the opinion, I don't think one is imminent. It doesn't mean one won't happen, but I think that the Chinese side as you mentioned is very nervous about I suppose the very ad hoc way that that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. And that sort of brings me to the the second point, which is outcomes, right? So beyond the optics of of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that he was not aware of or didn't agree to or anything like that. There's a lot riding on this meeting, right? I mean, Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Besson to the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the phase one trade deal from way back in 2020. So, I mean, if it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US-China trade and economic tension, right? The equally, if it goes badly, I mean, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work and if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think grow increasingly dim and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain or at least agreeing to work towards something that'll help to satisfy both sides, that that reduces dramatically, right? And the fact that working level groups have apparently stalled out, mean that it's going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it's really important that both sides get this right and if they don't, I mean, I think it could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side doesn't want to see and ultimately would would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, I totally agree with you, both. I think I I just want to kind of try and think through because, you know, our job is trying to be forward looking. As you kind of talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. And I think what could happen is actually, you know, Andrew, you kind of mentioned that Trump prefer kind of pop down kind of approach and for the Chinese, they kind of prefer kind of bottom up. And I think the possible way out is probably start from someone kind of at middle level, which is, you know, both leaders appoint a deputy who is kind of in charge of this and they can hash things out. And if we look at back to Trump 1.0, it's basically Leihiser hashed out a deal with Liu He, right? So far, we haven't seen that level, kind of very productive engagement at that level. I think Vice Premier Liu He had one call with the counterpart in the states side, but not much kind of engagement so far. But I think it it still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that kind of process. It's basically they hop up on the call saying, hey, you know, this deal is is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it. I think if one thing.

Andrew Polk:
Can I ask you if you can...

Ether Yin:
Yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Polk:
I was just going to ask you, so, I mean, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ether Yin:
Liu He.

Andrew Polk:
I'm struggling on the US side to think who it would be. Partly because I just like I said, I think Donald Trump wants to take the lead and isn't quite inclined to back any of his cabinet secretaries to necessarily believe that I basically don't think he trusts them to take that over. This is just my reading of it so far. Obviously, Daines, the the Senator that we talked about from Montana is trying to sort of make a play to become an envoy. So I mean, I'll just leave that US side aside for now, because it's not quite clear to me who that would be. But my question for you is who do you think it would be on the Chinese side?

Ether Yin:
It will be Vice Premier Liu He. He has a portfolio. US-China commercial relation is under him, and also he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. So he is a perfect person. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Great.

Ether Yin:
And he is a very savvy operative, very good at kind of enforcing whatever Xi Jinping wants.

Andrew Polk:
And so he's in lock step with Xi and knows sort of speak for Xi.

Ether Yin:
Yes.

Andrew Polk:
Yes. And I think that's the challenge on the US side is like it's not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump.

Andrew Polk:
Okay, so that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider Geo.
