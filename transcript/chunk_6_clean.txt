Ether Yin:
Nvidia opened the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think they by singling out those companies, they are basically showing to the world, here are a few red line issues for us. You know, that's one thing. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. So for each issue, we set an example. I think that's kind of their approach. And the second one, I think, exactly to your point, Andrew, about there's, you know, maybe with the exception of Illumina, there's no punishment. I think it's still our view that the end goal here is that they are preparing, the Chinese is being preparing for getting back to the table with Trump and to negotiate a deal. And when both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage you have or bargaining chips you have, right? For Trump, there's a lot of chips because in the past few years, there are so many tariffs, there are so many sanctions, so many Chinese companies on the sanctions list. But if you look at Chinese companies, they don't have much bargaining chips. So they've been announcing those investigations without announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargaining chips. You know, if you remove certain Chinese company off your list, I'll remove those US companies off my list, right? So I think that's kind of the thing they've been trying to prepare.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a great point. Great point. And I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground, and just another quick plug. We'll be watching all of this stuff, especially on the sanctions and export controls and law fair side very closely. And we hope for, you know, non-Chinese companies and investors to figure this stuff out and navigate it. You know, if you have an issue with this stuff or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at hq@triviumchina.com. We'd love to work with you. But in the meantime, let's wrap it up there. Guys, Joe, Ether, so great to have you on the pod for the first time. I'm sure this is the first among many. So, thanks to you both for being here.
