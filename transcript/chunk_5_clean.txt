Andrew Polk:
US side is like, it's not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump. Okay, so that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geopolitical kind of moment that we're in that's sort of shaping the context for that. And we'll see what happens with this potential Trump-Xi meeting. But in the meantime, I want to talk about the last thing that we have on our list today, which we've been tracking closely, which is China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic warfare. In terms of how they're choosing to hit back against US tariffs and export controls, etc. So this week we had a pretty big new development on this front with the State Council issuing new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. As a reminder, China passed the anti-foreign sanctions law or AFSL in 2021 as part of a larger effort to build a legal framework to strike back against foreign economic coercion, particularly from the US. And so these new regulations strengthen the enforceability of China's existing counter-sanctions toolkit by clarifying the law's scope and prohibited activities. Specifically, the regulation stipulate that "any foreign country, organization, or individual that implements, assists, or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development interests" is liable to be sanctioned. And so they also lay out specific punishments if you are sanctioned or listed under the anti-foreign sanctions law, there's a list of punishments. And then finally, these regulations specify a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement. So Joe, let me bring you back in, or throw this over to you. You know, we've got these bevy of foreign executives in Beijing, and Beijing's saying, "Hey, we're open for business, come invest." During that meeting, they implement these regulations or release these regulations that say, "Oh, by the way, here's how we can punish foreign companies if they comply with US or European sanctions." So what's going on here? What do we make of it?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, I suppose the overall message that China wants to send, putting it all together, is that, yes, we are open for business, we welcome you to participate in China's development, and we will continue opening and providing you a better business environment. But if you try to harm our economic interests or basically carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, then we have the power to strike back. In perfect fairness, I mean, this is sort of the implication that underlies business in any country, right? Is no country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as harming its national security, right? But I mean, what I would say is that, yes, I think there is sort of an inherent contradiction there, but I think it's also an effort to sort of clarify or give a little bit of clarity to foreign companies about, you know, where the red lines are and what's at stake. Right? So I think, you know, a criticism about China's treatment of foreign companies in the past has been, well, it's it's random, it's opaque, you never know if you're going to be on the chopping block. And I think that China's really keen to sort of move away from that narrative or to counteract that narrative by saying, look, here are the specific things that will get you in trouble, here are the specific penalties that you can expect to face, and these are the specific organizations that are going to be carrying it out, right? I think that's the message that China wants to send. I don't know if that's going to be received as such by foreign companies because you're right. I mean, it does on the face of it seem a little bit contradictory. But I think the point here is that China wants to make it clear to foreign companies that you are welcome to do business in China so long as you follow the rules and these are what those rules are.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah, great points, great points. Ether, your thoughts on this, on the regs from the Council on the AFSL.

Ether Yin:
No, I think my point will be, I think Chinese policymakers has showed this kind of consistently for past three years is that they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress on that. And this regulation is just one of that and I'm sure we'll see more, you know, next. My point there is that I think the Chinese policymakers kind of intention with this thing is not to use those tools at the first place. This is purely for, you know, if US has put out either kind of sanctions or tariffs and hurting Chinese economy and industries, they will use these tools to retaliate. I think when they kind of view it from that lens, you know, they view it as we are doing kind of self-defense. And unfortunately, foreign companies becomes the collateral damage of that.

Andrew Polk:
Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. So what strikes me, we've been covering all the what we call, you know, economic coercion toolkit or the lawfare toolkit that China has been building up for several years now. We've been covering it very closely since 2018. Basically, this is one of the big things we've been waiting for because we've been telling our clients like, hey, they can't really use the AFSL. It's not ready for prime time because they haven't done some of the detailed work to make sure that they know which agency's in charge of which aspects of the punishments. And these regs, they address that issue, right? And so, I mean, it's a very clear signal to me that the AFSL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time and that it will be used, as you said, as retaliation, and not, I think, proactively necessarily to punish foreign companies to try to get them to do China's bidding just in general, but even used as a reactionary or retaliatory tool. I mean, it just puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions frat back and forth. I mean, what do you do if you're a business?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, so I would add to that, is, yeah, I mean, I do think that this is probably a prelude to them, to these regulations being used more extensively. And just if you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach. It's like, yes, there have been some counter-tariffs, but much more targeted compared with the blanket US tariffs. And I think a bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. And so, yes, obviously, that's going to be something that spooks foreign companies and particularly US companies. However, the companies that I'm thinking of in question, so PVH Group and Illumina, there was also a fairly direct political tie-in, where they had both done things that were seen as kind of directly infringing on China's interests. So in PVH, that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains. And in the case of Illumina, that was lobbying sort of against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. So I think it's not just going to be China pulling names of random US companies out of a hat and saying, oh, bad luck. I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to and say, yeah, you actively sought to harm our development interests. So now you're going on the list. So, I mean, that may or may not be comforting at all to US companies because it's possible that, you know, it these these are these are possibly things that will be applied ex-post facto. It's they did something, you know, a few years ago that China didn't like, and for that reason, they end up as part of the next round of retaliation. But yeah, I mean, it will be primarily defensive. It won't be particularly random. I think there will almost always be a political tie-in.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, let me just make one observation before I throw it to you for the last word, Ether, is I'll just say, Joe, that's a good point. And also, in both the case of PVH and Illumina, which they weren't put on the AFSL, but were put on the unreliable entities list, the punishment, as far as I know, there still has been no specific announced punishment for PVH. And then for Illumina, the punishment was sort of just like you can't import certain gene sequencers into China. But you can still make those gene sequencers inside China, where they have a big footprint. So a pretty kind of slap on the wrist-y punishment. All that is to say, I do think they're going to use it more proactively, but I think they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here. So I just want to add that onto what you said, Joe, and then Ether, you know, what do you think?

Joe Mazur:
And

Andrew Polk:
And finally, sorry, one more quick thing is it's a deterrent, right? The idea, it's it's hopefully, it's the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on notice, say, oh, man, we really got to be careful about this and to kind of reassess their operations to say, are we doing anything that could run us a foul of these regulations? So I think first and foremost, well, it I mean, it is the defensive tool, but also it's it's hopefully one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books. I'm I'm sure it will get used more extensively, but I think that that's sort of a secondary purpose of these regulations.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, the book. Go ahead.

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I want to add points you both kind of made is that, I think for multi-national companies, the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously is an important point to remember. I think that cautiousness will be reflected, reflected in two fronts. I think on one, on first one, what we'll see is that if you kind of look at all the companies been put on, you know, EUL or other kind of list, I can see they are trying to basically outlining the Chinese government kind of red lines by singling out one company who is doing very badly on that. You know, if you look at PVH, it's about Xinjiang. If you look at kind of Illumina, it's about, you know, biotech. I think, you know, the next one was looking at if is if they're going to do anything with US chip industry. I mean, they already put Nvidia, open the the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think they by by singling out those company, they're basically showing to the world here are
