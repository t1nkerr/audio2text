Ether Yin:
about the China's economy, you know, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like we're willing to stimulate more. We've got a bunch of tools in our toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And oh by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape, and we're sort of going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, if you look at like just kind of all the kind of Chamber of Commerce kind of survey, foreign Chamber of Commerce kind of survey, uh you know, last year, they're basically across Chamber of Commerce. The kind of top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this kind of geopolitical tension. And I think kind of this especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. And the second one is geopolitical tension. I think that kind of like order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most of kind of multinational companies, geopolitical top one concern, but economy, I think is still kind of like one of the the second concern. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of, you know, senior business executives, you know, some of our clients. And the mood was actually like, despite the economy being pretty bad, like the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024. Yeah, yeah. I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So they were COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then 2023, people were sort of sending lower level executives through, kind of trying to get their feet back into the China market. And then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was like a lot of positive energy around these for business people finally being back in China. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on it a little bit. But and then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying like, we've got the economies back, we know the issues. But does anybody believe it? You know what I mean? Truly, where are businesses heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I think in terms of kind of like the business kind of vibes, I think for Chinese kind of business, and even nice since that among the public a little bit is actually right after Chinese New Year, kind of the sentiment kind of getting to a start to improve, or getting warmed up. I think,

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025. So February 25.

Ether Yin:
Yes. Okay. And and I think the biggest thing happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year, if you all cannot remember, the deep seek, overnight become a headline globally, right? Kind of tanked the US stock market, you know, even kind of temporarily, but still basically made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to the both public sentiment and the business sentiment, I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular is that basically over the past few years, you're under this kind of narrative or sense that we, by we, I mean kind of China's kind of economy, or China's kind of industries being kind of suppressed by the US, either both government, you know, sanctions and also US business. But just because of kind of deep seek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough, we can argue that if that's true or not, and and and to what extent that's true, but still that give the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, you know, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that, you know, containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, you know, manufacturing, everyone want to figure out, you know, in their business, how they can integrate into this AI thing. And I think visibly, in Premier Li's kind of government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of kind of deep seek, they even changed some language in the government work report, because some of the kind of AI initiative wouldn't be possible without, you know, deep six kind of, kind of success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to, I think, kind of global investors revaluation of Chinese stock market, and, you know, the the price going up, you know, a lot of kind of folks here has investment in that, that also helps to kind of boost kind of sentiment. And then that lead to March two sessions, you know, uh I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which is basically to the public and the industry here that, okay, government will keep their promise that, you know, the policy, economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So, I think that kind of changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I mean, I want to bring Joe in here, because the reason I say that's huge is, so I've just said I was at, you know, in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was sort of optimism just because like, it was the first time these senior executives had been in China. They felt like they were like re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled and over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024. I was in China at, you know, during both of those periods, and it became evident at that point, like, sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses and domestic individuals was, I mean, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing markets still under wraps. People don't want to spend money, just like, things are not good. And so hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months, that's really starting to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've lived in China for what, I mean, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in in sentiment as well, just among kind of yourself as a consumer in China, your network, you know, of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that all that?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with between like a gap of several months, you could in some ways are better positioned to say like, oh, this is different from the last time I was here. Whereas me it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot. Is you kind of don't realize the change until all of a sudden you. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether, kind of just on the on the anecdotal level. Yeah, last year it was my my friends in Beijing, it was kind of doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people you were saying to me, well, my my parents kind of pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in in in in terms of price. And I kind of feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see kind of fewer closed storefronts, which I think has sort of been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well. And I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather is starting to get nice, maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, and I mean, I think that there have been a number of I think developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about deep seek. But I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China maybe feel like they're not so not so bad off. So, I mean, you're certainly, you know, reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even the thing like the She-Hong-Shu phenomenon, where it was the first time in possibly ever where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on on a large scale. I think, you know, whether or not, you know, they gained a fully accurate picture of one another. I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China. And there's a lot of aspects of it about the US, which are, you know, quite troubling. Again, I mean, we can we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given kind of the the information ecosystems are are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I mean, I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. And so, yeah, I mean, I I wouldn't say it's like a a massive night and day shift, but it's certainly just as a a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as as an economic indicator. It does seem somewhat better than than in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, Joe made a great point. I think the other kind of aspect here or contributing factor here is that actually kind of the Chinese kind of are kind of over prepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone expecting a second term would be, you know, very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still, you know, not great, but still kind of like, you know, better than expected. And also on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China, because, you know, seems like the US family is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like, it's US against the world. You know, everyone suffers, it's not just us, that also kind of helps you to kind of like, you know, improve your how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean, that's really interesting because just as you guys were talking, both of you. I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak
