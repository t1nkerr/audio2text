Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. We'll start with another of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yeen. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yeen:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. Feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. And then we are also delighted to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazer. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazer:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you on, not only because I don't get to see you very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss the biggest development out of China this week: the annual China Development Forum, or CDF. This forum is where foreign executives come to Beijing to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether, our overall policy guru who is also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. What we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. We'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is the latest development on the economic coercion front: Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. Lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazer:
Yeah, the vibes are good. Just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but that we're at turbo speed. So you're very much in line with everybody else. Let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yeen:
First of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work, which is this company. We're doing great, having you come to Shanghai makes me feel super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain about. If we're talking about the general vibe in regard to the China business environment, that gets interesting, because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, if we are talking about Chinese private business, the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about why that is and what happened later. But if we're talking about foreign business, it's probably on a different track. There are some improvements for them. That's probably on the domestic front. But also, just in general, the external challenges they're facing now are getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. On a net, I don't know where that puts them. In general, compared to Chinese private business, they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China have ups and downs. But that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you. I was on the podcast yesterday, I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. That's amazing. To give people a little peek behind the curtain on how Trivium works, we're a small company, but as I often say, we have multinational problems. We very rarely get to be face-to-face with our colleagues, and it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. Really loving that. Thanks for the vibe checks. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the meat of the discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual. First, I always have to stress, we're not just a podcast. Trivium China is a strategic advisory firm that helps businesses and investors navigate the China policy landscape.

It really helps people to learn more about Trivium and hopefully grows the audience for the podcast so we get to inform more people about what's going on in China on a week-to-week basis. With that, let's get into the China Development Forum. It happened over the past couple of days. We're recording on Wednesday, March 26th. It was Monday and Tuesday. We'll talk a little about what the forum is exactly. It's been held annually since 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from previous years. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically a speech from the premier, talking up the economy. It's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little of what Premier Li Qiang talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders. That was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to not meet with the premier. The meeting with the premier is usually the highlight for these executives. Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yeen:
No, I just want to point out. If you look at the premier's meetings with business, it's still, I could argue, disappointing for some foreign businesses, because the setting is primarily focused on US business. And the US delegation at the meeting is led by the Republican senator. You can still argue that meeting is not inclusive enough to address the entire foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. And geopolitics, obviously, and the US-China relationship specifically, hang over everything. It's interesting, you did mention Steve Daines, who's, Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazer:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. He's here along with the delegation, potentially trying to lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year, as the focus was heavily on US businesses. We'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead. But it's all about the US business community, and the European and Asian communities are thinking, "How do we fit in?" It just underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message you really got from Premier Li Qiang and other senior Chinese government officials? What message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazer:
If it's not obvious,
