Andrew Polk: is at the moment. Give us any other takeaways from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry how they feel about the China market. For all those reasons, it's an event not to be missed and it has drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. It's also a chance to show that, you know, we're in China for China, and they kind of express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that's come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. If you follow these meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So, things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. These are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and from Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece, which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overtures the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important. It's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. That's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I guess one follow-up question. The Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions for decades, right? That used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree, or is it still worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have as strong of a voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, it's a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. Certainly, I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, hey, think about it. You've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market, and there are still more to come. So, it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries. Now I think, you know, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this business pressure does work, both positive and negative. In the lead up to the EU's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs back in, I think, November, there was a lot of politicking happening, and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats, to kind of win over votes to their side on that. But ultimately, those tariffs did go through. But I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. My immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and this America First economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But certainly it doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? Maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the Trump administration, maybe not on behalf of China but with coterminous goals with China, then maybe there's something to be said for that, and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's a... Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I think that's actually a very interesting question. I want to kind of ask you guys about, in particular, Andrew, because you know, most of the time you're based in DC, so you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared to Trump and Biden, on the Trump administration, there's more room for US business to influence policy? My assumption would be my understanding with Biden, because his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. Basically, when the US has a conversation trying to influence certain policies, and when it reaches, "Okay, this is a national security matter for the US government," then that's the end of the conversation. There's no room for US business to continue to influence. But with Trump, it's more like there are basically no principles or not many red lines, if there's more room for US business to influence his policies.

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking. As I often say, I mean this is great because you guys are in China thinking about what the US side is doing. We do, obviously, as I say to our listeners, I always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to, of course, what's happening at the CDF. My view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. That's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration officials saying, basically your companies are part of the problem. You have to create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. You're part of the problem, and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things you have done. And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way, "you're part of the problem," but was also kind of maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons that you said, which was, the Biden administration just said, "Well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them." Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses, or a lot of US businesses, trying to get on Trump on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all this other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration, generally and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were last time.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean that's good to know, that's good to know, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Do you have another question? I'm going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually kind of, I mean, understanding that actually kind of helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether Premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to resist protectionism or these things are going to work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because, you know, for multinational companies, they're facing increasing pressure either from their home country government or even from the public, right? To a certain extent, you know, bringing jobs back, bringing production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So, that's one thing. And the other thing on the message is, you know, the premier wanted to send at CDF is really the master plan. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, you know, the government has the back of the economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when the government announced very aggressive or expensive fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcasts. I think the other key message the premier is really trying to bring home at CDF is that, you know, everyone knows things can get worse later this year if, say, Trump dramatically increases tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly. So, one key message Li Qiang is trying to send is that we, the policymakers, also thought about that and we already have a plan. And this time we'll be better prepared, and before that even happens, we will release additional policies, i.e., policies not included in the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to set that message loud and clear just to assure, you know, if you are worried about China's economy, we have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like we're willing to stimulate more.
