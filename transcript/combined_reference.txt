Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody, and welcome to the latest Trivium China Podcast, a proud member of The Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China Co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. And I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. Feel excited about, you know, joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. Yeah. And then we're also glad to have our Head of Geopolitical Research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because, you know, I don't get to see you guys very much, and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, being our Lead Geopolitical Analyst and Ether being our, well, overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss, you know, the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling, sort of against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is kind of the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China, or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside, and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing, or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues that I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also I mean, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to sort of the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think, you know, first of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work, which is this company. I think we're doing great. Also, have you guys coming in Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. About how's the vibe, general vibe in regard to the China business environment, I think that gets to interesting, because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think, you know, if we are talking about Chinese private business, I think the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about why, what happened, later. But I think if we're talking about foreign business, it's probably a different track. I think there are some improvement. Improved for the, I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also, you know, I think just in general, external challenges they're facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that puts them. I think in general they are compared to Chinese private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and, as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday, I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing, just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems, is kind of what I say, small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face-to-face with our colleagues, and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the meat of the discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes as usual.

So all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days, so we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, you know, talking about the economy. He's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier, talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year, they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to meet with the premier. The meeting with the premier is usually kind of the highlight for these executives. But yeah, kind of giving that background. Oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin:
No, I just want to point out. I think if you look at the premier's meetings with business, it's still, I could argue, for some business, some foreign business is still disappointing because the whole setting is primarily focused on US business. And I think the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican senator. So, you can also argue, you can still argue, you know, that meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. And the geopolitics obviously, and the US-China specifically relationship, hang over everything. It's interesting you did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your home state, Montana?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so don't want to jump too far ahead, but it's kind of is all about the US business community. And the European business community, and the Asian community are kind of like, well, what about us? How do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec, and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, you know, from his what is the senior government or senior government officials on the Chinese side, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, you know, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious,

============================================================
CHUNK 2 (Minutes 9.83 - 20.00)
============================================================

Joe Mazur:

Yeah, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry how they feel about the China market. So, just for all those reasons, it's an event not to be missed and it's drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. It's also a chance to show that we're in China for China and to express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important.

But in terms of the messaging that comes out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. If you follow these meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. Things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. These are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and just of Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general.

There's also a piece that I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism, right? So the hope is that these companies, as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, "Hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving, and it's worth expanding." That's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:

Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question. The Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions, at least for decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working, or is business heard from your perspective in other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree, or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a strong of a voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:

Yeah, I mean, it's a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I mean, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, "Hey, think about it, you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market, and there are still more to come." So, it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries.

Now, I think, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative. Sort of in the lead-up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in November, there was a lot of politicking happening, and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats, to win over votes to their side on that. Ultimately, those tariffs did go through, but it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this sort of wheeling and dealing.

For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. My immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and this America First economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But it certainly doesn't hurt to try, and who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the Trump administration, maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminus goals with China, I think maybe there's something to be said for that, and maybe that would be enough to get the US to at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Andrew Polk:

Yeah, I mean, Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:

I think that's actually a very interesting question. And I actually want to ask you guys about, in particular, Andrew, you because you know, most of the time you're based in DC, so you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared to Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, there's more room for US businesses to influence policy a little bit? My assumption would be, my understanding with Biden, because his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. And basically, when US businesses have conversations trying to influence certain policies, and when they reach, "Okay, this is a national security matter for US," then that's the end of the conversation. There's no room for US business to continue influence. But with Trump, it's more like there are basically no principles or not many red lines. Is there more room for US business to influence his policies?

Andrew Polk:

That's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking, as I often say, because this is great because you guys are in China thinking about what the US side is doing. We do, obviously, as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point, and it's pertinent to, of course, what's happening at the CDF.

My view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. That's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration, in the first Trump administration, Trump administration officials saying, "Basically, your companies are part of the problem. You've helped create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem, and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done." And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way, "You're part of the problem," but it was also maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons that you said, which was, the Biden administration just said, "Well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them."

Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses, a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump's good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all this other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, you know, giving, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in the second Trump administration, generally, and potentially when it comes to China. And basically, companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were last time.

Ether Yin:

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's good to know. That's good to know, yeah.

Andrew Polk:

Do you have another question? Or who's going to throw one back at you?

Ether Yin:

No, I was just going to say that's actually, I mean, I understand that actually helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether Premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to resist protectionism or these things will work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because, you know, multinational companies are facing increasing pressure, either from their home country government or even from the public, right? So, because to a certain extent, you know, bring jobs back, bring production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing.

And the other thing on the messages, you know, the Premier wanted to send at the CDF is really the master plan. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, you know, government has the back of the economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when, you know, the government announced very aggressive or expensive fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcasts. I think the other key message the Premier is really trying to drive home at CDF is that, you know, everyone knows things can get worse later this year if, say, Trump dramatically increases tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly. So one key message that Li Qiang is trying to send is that we also, the policymakers also thought about that, and we already have a plan. And this time, we will be better prepared. And before that even happens, we will release additional policies, policies not included in the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to send that message loud and clear just to assure, you know, if you are worried about the China's economy, you know, we have a plan to deal with that. So don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:

Yeah, so they're trying to say basically, "We're willing to stimulate more."

============================================================
CHUNK 3 (Minutes 19.83 - 30.00)
============================================================

Ether Yin:
the China's economy. We have a plan to deal with that, so don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like, we're willing to stimulate more. We've got a bunch of tools in the toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And, oh, by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape and we're sort of going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, if you look at just kind of all the kinds of Chamber of Commerce kind of survey, foreign Chamber of Commerce kind of survey, you know, last year, they're basically across Chamber of Commerce, the kind of top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this kind of geopolitical tension. And I think kind of this, especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. And the second one is geopolitical tension. I think that kind of like the order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most of kind of multinational companies, geopolitical top one concern. But economy, I think is still kind of like one of the second concern. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is, I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of senior business executives, some of our clients. And the mood was actually like, despite the economy being pretty bad, like, the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So they were covered policy all the way to the end of 2022. Then 2023, people were sort of sending lower level executives through, kind of trying to get their feet back into the China market, and then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was like a lot of positive energy around these for business people finally being back in China. But then, throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what's your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on it a little bit. And then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying like, we've got the economy's back. We know the issues, but does anybody believe it? You know what I mean? Truly, where are businesses' heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I think in terms of kind of like the business kind of vibes, I think for Chinese kind of business, and even I sense that among the public a little bit is actually right after the Chinese New Year, kind of the sentiment kind of getting to a start to improve, or getting warmed up. I think,

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025. So February 25.

Ether Yin:
Yes.

Andrew Polk:
Okay.

Ether Yin:
And I think the biggest thing happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year, if you remember the Deepseek Go One Eye become a headline globally, right? Kind of tanked the US stock market, even kind of temporarily, but still basically made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to the both public sentiment and the business sentiment. I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular is that basically over the past few years, you're under this kind of narrative or saying that we, by we, I mean, kind of China's kind of economy or China's kind of industries being kind of suppressed by the US, either both government, you know, sanctions and also US business. But just because of kind of Deepseek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue that if that's true or not and to what extent that's true. But still, that gave the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, you know, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, you know, manufacturing, everyone wants to figure out, you know, in their business how they can integrate into this AI thing. And I think visibly in premier these kind of government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of kind of Deepseek, they even changed some language in the government work report because some of the kind of AI initiative wouldn't be possible without, you know, Deepseek Go One Eye's kind of success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to, I think, global investors revaluation of Chinese stock market and, you know, the price going up, you know, a lot of kind of folks here has investment in that, that also helps to kind of boost kind of sentiment. And then that leads to March to sessions. I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which is basically to the public and industry here that okay, government will keep their promise that, you know, the policy, economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So I think that kind of changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I mean, I want to bring Joe in here, because the reason I say that's huge is so I just said, I was at, you know, in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF 2024, so that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was sort of optimism just because like, it was the first time these senior executives had been in China, they felt like they were like re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024, though, the economy really struggled over the summer of 2024 and in the fall of 2024. I was in China, you know, during both of those periods, and it became evident at that point, like sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses and domestic individuals was, I mean, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing markets still under wraps. People don't want to spend money. Just like, things are not good. And so hearing that you're saying, you think just in the past few months, that's really starting to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've lived in China for what, I mean, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in in sentiment as well? Just among kind of yourself as a consumer in China, your network, you know, of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that all that?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with between a gap of several months, you could in some ways are better positioned to say like, oh, this is different than the last time I was here. Whereas me, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot. You kind of don't realize the change until all of a sudden it will do. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether kind of just on the on the anecdotal level. Yeah, last year it was my my friends in Beijing. It was kind of doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people were saying to me, well, my my parents kind of pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in in in in terms of price, and I kind of feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see kind of fewer closed storefronts, which I think is sort of been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well, and I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather is starting to get nice, and maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, and I mean, I think that there have been a number of I think developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about Deepseek. But I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China maybe feel like they're not so not so bad off. So I mean, they're certainly, you know, reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even something like the Shell Hong Shu phenomenon, where it was the first time in possibly ever, where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on on a large scale. I think, you know, whether or not, you know, they gained a fully accurate picture of one another, I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China, and there's a lot of aspects of the about the US, which are, you know, quite troubling. Again, I mean, we can we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given kind of the the information ecosystems are are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I mean, I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. And so, yeah, I mean, I I wouldn't say it's like a a massive night and day shift, but it's certainly just as a a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as as an economic indicator, it does seem somewhat better than in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, Joe made a great point. I think the other kind of aspect here, or contributing factor here is that actually the Chinese are overprepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like, everyone expecting a second Trump would be very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still not great, but still kind of like better than expected. And also on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China, because, you know, it seems like the US family is very focused on taking on China. But now it's like, it's US against the world. You know, everyone suffers. It's not just us. That also kind of helps you kind of like, you know, improve your how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean, that's really interesting, because just as you guys were talking, both of you. I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak

============================================================
CHUNK 4 (Minutes 29.83 - 40.00)
============================================================

Andrew Polk:
I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we’ve really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business confidence, the struggling real estate market, and how if the government was going to turn things around, they needed a catalyst. They needed something to change the narrative, something to sort of join people onto a better path. And our thesis was kind of like, well, the government will have to do it. It’ll have to do it at the Third Plenum, which happened last year, or do it at the Two Sessions. And it kept feeling like the government was missing these opportunities, but then here, you know, the private sector, the deep-seek thing comes, and maybe it seems like, you know, we’ll wait to see, it’s only been, you know, a month and a half or so, but maybe that was the catalyst that they needed, and then I will say that the government has really ridden the wake of that and said, you know what, from that deep-seek development, like you said, how important AI is, and how we now have a path towards putting it into government policy, supporting it through government policy, and we see now a path for, we see, recognize the role of the private sector in accomplishing some of the tech goals that we want to accomplish. And so, it turns out that maybe the catalyst was totally outside the, you know, purview or really even expectation of the Chinese government, and it truly did come from this private sector company.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, and not to overuse it, but I do think, you know, if you kind of remember last year, you know, things are great in Q1, and I think the thing started to kind of go bad in Q2. I do want to say there’s a few things here. Second, it depends on whether, you know, Trump decided to tighten the screw on China again, you know, significantly increased tariffs. I think that does have a significant impact of that. And I think more importantly is, if that happens, will the policymakers do as they say, which is to deploy additional policy support in a very timely manner, because if that happens again, I can see this kind of fragile kind of confidence kind of building up, going to go away very quickly.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so, 100%. It is not the slam dunk that we are now on a new path. But this is our business. We watch this stuff closely, if we try to see kind of if we are on the new trajectory. But speaking that’s a great, actually, perfect pivot point. Speaking of Trump and potentially New Tariffs, this kind of constant “will they, won’t they” reporting around whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will meet. And again, like, I just want to re-emphasize the whole point of this podcast to try to think about China’s perspective on things. And here, and not make it all about US-China, but with the CDF and kind of this context this week, you know, I think this is particularly relevant, diving into, you know, the potential for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. And so, just before I came over here, I had some meetings with some Chinese officials in DC, and they were expressing to me a point that I thought was, made sense from what I know about the Chinese system. Because we were talking about whether or not Xi Jinping and Donald Trump would meet. They were like, we have no idea, but, just so you know, like, our normal operating procedure is to have working-level meetings, to iron out a lot of details, a lot of back and forth. Then we kick that up to the next level, after a lot of things have been either agreed upon or ironed out to the next higher level, maybe it’s the ministerial/you know, cabinet level. Those people work out, then we go up to the next level, which might be the senior leaders, the Heads of State. They meet, it’s pretty much just kind of pro forma. They’re just putting their signatures on things that have already been agreed. That’s how we like to operate, right? And I was like, well, those working-level meetings don’t seem like they’re happening. They’re like, no, they’re not happening. And but obviously, Donald Trump, and so, first of all, those working-level meetings, like I said, aren’t happening. I think maybe not obviously, but Donald Trump clearly wants to go the other way. He wants to start at the Head of State, and basically have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, sort things out, and then go top-down instead of bottom-up. Have everybody below them then work out the details of how to get things done. So, I guess let me bring in Joe again here, and then we’ll bring you in again Ether. Do you think that’s the right read on the situation, Joe? And secondly, I mean, where does that put you in terms of whether or not a meeting truly is likely soon?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, I think that absolutely tracks, as I mean, I think to some extent, diplomats are very protocol-conscious no matter where they’re from. And I think that’s especially true in the Chinese system, where just the political, you know, politics is very choreographed in most respects. And beyond just sort of the simple, you know, questions of protocol, I think this is coming at an extremely delicate time, obviously, in US-China relations, both in terms of optics and outcomes. So, you know, when we’re talking about optics, right? There was, there was one of the reports I read suggested that the US side had floated Xi Jinping going to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump, and maybe that was something that Trump himself had suggested. Of course, that’s the kind of thing that makes Xi look like a supplicant. You’re going to not only, you know, Trump’s home turf in terms of being in the States, but his literal home turf. Yeah, you know, there were other suggestions that Donald Trump could pay a state visit to China as soon as April, which I think is something that the Chinese side would be much more amenable to, because that a lot more of the protocol is then then in their hands, and they played the gracious host. And there have been another number of other kind of suggestions as to when and where they might meet. After the initial few reports on a possible Trump-Xi meeting, I’m now kind of of the opinion, I don’t think one is imminent. It doesn’t mean one won’t happen, but I think that the Chinese side, as you mentioned, is very nervous about I suppose the very ad hoc way that Donald Trump approaches diplomacy. And that sort of brings me to the second point, which is outcomes, right? So beyond the optics of Xi not wanting to be seen as a supplicant or to be ambushed with some kind of proposal that he was not aware of or didn’t agree to or anything like that, there’s a lot riding on this meeting. Right? I mean, Trump has repeatedly said that he has a good relationship with Xi Jinping, that he would like to strike some kind of deal. I think it was Scott Bessent, who the Treasury Secretary proposed possibly some kind of agreement whereby China could make good on its purchases from the Phase One trade deal from way back in 2020. So, I mean, if it goes well, if a Trump-Xi meeting were to go well, you could see possibly a stabilization or even a resolution of some of the big issues at the heart of US-China trade and economic tension. Right? But equally, if it goes badly, I mean, you probably really only have this one shot to make it work, and if it goes badly after that, the prospects of another summit, I think, grow increasingly dim, and that possibility of striking some kind of grand bargain, or at least agreeing to work towards something that’ll help to satisfy both sides, that that reduces dramatically, right? And the fact that working-level groups have apparently stalled out, mean that it’s going to really require the impetus of the two leaders to move things forward. So, it’s really important that both sides get this right, and if they don’t, well, I mean, I think it could be the beginning of a fairly long downward spiral, which certainly the Chinese side doesn’t want to see and ultimately would would probably be pretty destructive to the US as well.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally agree with you both. I think, I just want to kind of try and do things through because, you know, our job is trying to be forward-looking. As you kind of talk about, the stakes are pretty high for both sides on this deal. And I think what could happen is actually, you know, Andrew, you kind of mentioned that Trump prefer kind of top-down kind of approach and for the Chinese, they kind of prefer kind of bottom-up. And I think the possible way out is probably to start from someone at a middle level, which is, you know, both leaders appoint a deputy who is kind of in charge of this, and they can hash things out. And if we look at back to Trump 1.0, it’s basically Lighthizer hashed out a deal with Liu He, right? So far, we haven’t seen that level, kind of very productive engagement at that level. I think Vice Premier He Lifeng had one call with a counterpart in the US side, but not much kind of engagement so far. But I think it still takes a call from both leaders to kick off that kind of process. It’s basically they hop on the call saying, hey, you know, this deal is important for both of us. Should we both appoint a deputy to kick off this process? That may be the way to go about it. I think if one thing…

Andrew Polk:
Can I ask you…?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Polk:
I was just going to ask you, so I mean, who on the Chinese side do you think that would be?

Ether Yin:
He Lifeng.

Andrew Polk:
I’m struggling on the US side to think who it would be, partly because, I just like I said, I think Donald Trump wants to take the lead and isn’t quite inclined to back any of his cabinet secretaries to necessarily be the leader. I basically don’t think he trusts them to take that over. That’s just my reading of it so far. Obviously, Daines, the Senator that we talked about from Montana, is trying to sort of make a play to become an envoy. So I mean, I’ll just leave that US side aside for now, because it’s not quite clear to me who that would be, but my question for you is who do you think it would be on the Chinese side?

Ether Yin:
You know, it would be Vice Premier He Lifeng. He has a portfolio. US-China commercial relation is under him, and also he is probably the most trusted official of Xi Jinping. So he is a perfect person. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, great.

Ether Yin:
And he is a very savvy operative. Very good at kind of enforcing whatever Xi Jinping wants.

Andrew Polk:
And so he’s in lockstep with Xi and knows…

Ether Yin:
Yes.

Andrew Polk:
…sort of speak for Xi. And I think that’s the challenge on the US side. It’s like, it’s not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump. Okay, so that’s been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geoeconomics.

============================================================
CHUNK 5 (Minutes 39.83 - 50.00)
============================================================

Andrew Polk:
US side, it's not exactly clear who speaks for Donald Trump.

Andrew Polk:
Okay, so that's been a great discussion on the CDF and the wider geopolitical moment that we're in that's shaping the context for that. And we'll see what happens with this potential Trump Xi meeting. But in the meantime, I want to talk about the last thing that we have on our list today, which we've been tracking closely, which is China's evolving approach to economic coercion or economic lawfare in terms of how they're choosing to hit back against US tariffs and export controls, etc. This week, we had a pretty big new development on this front with the State Council issuing new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. As a reminder, China passed the anti-foreign sanctions law or AFSL in 2021 as part of a larger effort to build a legal framework to strike back against foreign economic coercion, particularly from the US. These new regulations strengthen the enforceability of China's existing counter-sanctions toolkit by clarifying the law's scope and prohibited activities. Specifically, the regulations stipulate that, "Any foreign country, organization, or individual that implements, assists, or supports acts that endanger China's sovereignty, security, and development interests is liable to be sanctioned." And so they also lay out specific punishments if you are sanctioned or listed under the anti-foreign sanctions law, there's a list of punishments. And then finally, these regulations specify a clear division of labor for departments overseeing the law's enforcement. Joe, let me bring you back in. We've got these bevy of foreign executives in Beijing, and Beijing's saying, hey, we're open for business, come invest. During that meeting, they released these regulations that say, by the way, here's how we can punish foreign companies if they comply with US or European sanctions. So what's going on here? What do we make of it?

Joe Mazur:
Well, I suppose the overall message that China wants to send, putting it all together, is that, yes, we are open for business, we welcome you to participate in China's development, and we will continue opening and providing you a better business environment, but if you try to harm our economic interests or basically carry water for foreign governments trying to suppress China's economic interests, then we have the power to strike back. In perfect fairness, this is the implication that underlies business in any country, right? No country is going to accept a foreign entity which it sees as harming its national security, right? But what I would say is that, yes, there is an inherent contradiction there, but it's also an effort to clarify or give a little bit of clarity to foreign companies about where the red lines are and what's at stake. A criticism about China's treatment of foreign companies in the past has been, it's random, it's opaque, you never know if you're going to be on the chopping block. And I think that China is really keen to move away from that narrative or to counteract that narrative by saying, look, here are the specific things that will get you in trouble, here are the specific penalties that you can expect to face, and these are the specific organizations that are going to be carrying it out. That's the message that China wants to send. I don't know if that's going to be received as such by foreign companies, because you're right. It does, on the face of it, seem a little bit contradictory. But the point here is that China wants to make it clear to foreign companies that you are welcome to do business in China, so long as you follow the rules, and these are what those rules are.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, great points. Great points. Ether, your thoughts on this, on the regulations on the AFSL?

Ether Yin:
My point would be, Chinese policymakers have shown this consistently for the past few years, that they want to build out a legal toolbox where they can counter US sanctions. They've been doing that and making progress on that. This regulation is just one of those, and I'm sure we'll see more next. My point there is that the Chinese policymakers' intention with this is not to use those tools in the first place. This is purely for if the US puts out either sanctions or tariffs and hurts Chinese economy and industries, they will use these tools to retaliate. When they view it from that lens, they view it as self-defense. And unfortunately, foreign companies become the collateral damage of that.

Andrew Polk:
That's exactly what I was going to say. What strikes me is we've been covering what we call the economic coercion toolkit or the lawfare toolkit that China has been building out for several years now. We've been covering it very closely since 2018. This is one of the big things we've been waiting for, because we've been telling our clients they couldn't really use the AFSL. It's not ready for prime time because they haven't done some of the detailed work to make sure that they know which agencies are in charge of which aspects of the punishments, and these regulations address that issue, right? And so it's a very clear signal to me that the AFSL is now getting closer to being ready for prime time and that it will be used, as you said, as retaliation. Not proactively necessarily to punish foreign companies to try to get them to do China's bidding just in general. But even used as a reactionary or retaliatory tool, it just puts businesses right in the middle of a potential sanctions tit for tat back and forth. What do you do if you're a business?

Joe Mazur:
I would add that this is probably a prelude to these regulations being used more extensively. If you look at China's retaliation against the most recent Trump tariffs, it's been a multi-pronged approach. Yes, there have been some counter tariffs, but much more targeted compared with the blanket US tariffs. A bigger and possibly more important part of that response has been directly targeting US companies. So, obviously, that's going to be something that spooks foreign companies and particularly US companies. However, the companies that I'm thinking of in question, PVH Group and Illumina, had a fairly direct political tie-in, where they had both done things that were seen as directly infringing on China's interests. In PVH, that was the exclusion of Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, and in the case of Illumina, that was lobbying against Chinese competitors in the US Congress. It's not just going to be China pulling names of random US companies out of a hat and saying, bad luck. I expect there will almost always be a specific political tie-in that China can point to and say, yep, you actively sought to harm our development interests, so now you're going on the list. That may or may not be comforting at all to US companies, because it's possible that these are things that will be applied ex-post facto. They did something a few years ago that China didn't like, and for that reason, they end up as part of the next round of retaliation. It will be primarily defensive. It won't be particularly random. There will almost always be a political tie-in.

Andrew Polk:
Let me just make one observation before I throw it to you for the last word, Ether. I'll just say, Joe, that's a good point. Also, in both the cases of PVH and Illumina, they weren't put on the AFSL but were put on the unreliable entities list. The punishment, as far as I know, there still has been no specific announced punishment for PVH. And then for Illumina, the punishment was just that you can't import certain gene sequencers into China, but you can still make those gene sequencers inside China where they have a big footprint. So a pretty slap on the wrist punishment. All that is to say, I do think they're going to use it more proactively, but they will be cautious because they don't want to scare off the entire foreign business community. Their whole goal is to keep companies operating here. I just want to add that on to what you said, Joe, and then Ether, what do you think?

Joe Mazur:
Finally, one more quick thing is it's a deterrent, right? The idea is, hopefully, it's the sort of thing that puts foreign companies on notice to say, we really have to be careful about this and to reassess their operations to say, are we doing anything that could run us a foul of these regulations? First and foremost, it is the defensive tool, but also it's hopefully one that will achieve the intended result just by being on the books. I'm sure it will get used more extensively, but I think that that's a secondary purpose of these regulations.

Andrew Polk:
Go ahead, Ether.

Ether Yin:
I want to add to points you both made that for multinational companies, the Chinese regulators will use those tools very cautiously is an important point to remember. That cautiousness will be reflected in two fronts. On one, the first one, what we'll see is that if you look at all the companies put on the EUL or other list, they are trying to outline the Chinese government's red lines by singling out one company who is doing very badly on that. If you look at PVH, it's about Xinjiang. If you look at Illumina, it's about biotech. The next one we're looking at is if they're going to do anything with the US chip industry. They already opened a monopoly investigation on Nvidia. By singling out this company, they're showing to the world, here are the.

============================================================
CHUNK 6 (Minutes 49.83 - 52.37)
============================================================

Ether Yin:
Nvidia opened the monopoly investigation on Nvidia. I think by singling out those companies, they are basically showing to the world, here are a few red line issues for us. That's one thing. I don't think they are intended to expand that scope. So it's for each issue, we set an example. I think that's their approach. And the second one, I think, exactly to your point, Andrew, about there's, maybe with the exception of Lumina, there's no punishment. I think it's still our view that the end goal here is that they are preparing, the Chinese are preparing for getting back to the table with Trump and to negotiate a deal. And when both sides sit across the table, what kind of leverage you have or bargaining chips you have, right? For Trump, there's a lot of chips because in the past few years, there are so many tariffs, there are so many sanctions, so many Chinese companies are on the sanction list. But if you look at Chinese companies, they don't have much bargaining chips. So they've been announcing those investigations without announcing penalties, which makes them perfect bargaining chips. If you remove certain Chinese company off your list, I'll remove those US companies off my list, right? So I think that's the thing they've been trying to prepare.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a great point. Great point, and I think that's actually a great place to leave it for today. We obviously covered a lot of ground and just another quick plug, we'll be watching all of this stuff, especially on the sanctions and export controls and lawfare side very closely, and we help foreign, non-Chinese companies and investors figure this stuff out and navigate it. If you have an issue with this stuff or if you're anticipating needing to navigate this, reach out to us at hq@triviumchina.com. We'd love to work with you. But in the meantime, let's wrap it up there, guys. Joe, Ether, so great to have you on the pod for the first time. I'm sure this is the first among many. So thanks to you both for being here.

Ether Yin:
Yeah.

Joe Mazur:
All right, thanks everyone. Good having this conversation with you guys.

Ether Yin:
Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Absolutely. And after this, we can go grab some drinks together and hang out. All right, guys, you all take care. Thanks everybody for joining us and listening, and we'll see you next time. Bye everybody.

Ether Yin:
Bye, everyone.
