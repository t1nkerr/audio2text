Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I'm your host, Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai. And I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you. Excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. And then we're also delighted to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. A longtime listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Love it, love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome. But also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders and Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether, being our overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the kind of overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check, and I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, the vibes are good. I mean, just on a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues who I don't often get to see, the weather's very nice. But also on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life and in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, first of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work with this company. I think we're doing great. Also, have you guys come in Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. So about how's general vibe in regard to the China business environment. I think that gets to interesting, because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think if we are talking about Chinese private business, I think the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about why, what happened, later. But I think if we talking about foreign business, it's probably in a different track. I think there are some improvement improved for them. I think that's probably on the domestic front, but also I think just in general external challenges they are facing now is getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that put them. I think in general, they are compared to Chinese private business, I think they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get into why that is, why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was I'm the podcast yesterday, I told everybody, I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. I mean, we're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems, is kind of what I say. Small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be in face-to-face with our colleagues and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the media discussion, go through a couple of quick housekeeping notes, as usual.

So, all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days, so we're recording on Wednesday, the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024, and US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, talking about the economy. He's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier, talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to meet with the premier. The meeting with the premier's usually kind of the highlight for these executives, but yeah, giving that background. Oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin:
I just want to point out. I think if you look at that premier's meetings with business, it's still, I could argue for some business, some foreign business still disappointing because now the whole setting is primarily focused on US business. And I think that the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So, you can for sure argument, you can still argue that meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point and the geopolitics obviously, in the US-China specifically relationship, hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially move the groundwork or lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well. So don't want to jump too far ahead, but it's kind of is all about the US business community. And the European business community, and the Asian community are kind of like, well, how do we fit in? It just kind of underscores the point that geopolitics are hanging heavy over everything. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what it was the message that you really got from Li Qiang from his, what is the senior government or senior government officials on the Chinese side, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I mean, I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also an opportunity for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to possibly discuss with their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So, just for all those reasons, it's sort of an event not to be missed and really have drawn pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. It's also a chance to show that we're in China for China and they kind of express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions, to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and just about Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overture the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism. So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important. It's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. So that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I mean, I guess one follow-up question, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions, at least for, I mean, decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in, I mean, other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Is it or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a stronger voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I mean, certainly I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, you know, hey, think about it, you you've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it it it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries. So now I think, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are sort of two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative. In the lead up to the EU's decision to impose EVs on or tariffs on Chinese EVs back in I think it was November, there was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats to win over votes to their side on that. Ultimately, those tariffs did go through, but I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. I mean, my immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser focused on the trade deficit and and sort of this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But I mean, certainly it doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? I mean, maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO like Tim Cook lobbying the the Trump administration, sort of maybe not on behalf of China, but with co-terminus goals with China. Well, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to sort of at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean that's a

Ether Yin:
Go ahead, Ether.

Andrew Polk:
I think that's actually a very interesting question and I want to ask you guys about, I think in particular, Andrew, you because most of the time you're based in DC. So you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, there's more room for US business to influence policy a little bit? My assumption would be, my understanding with Biden because his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. And basically, when US business had conversation trying to influence certain policies and when you reach to, okay, this is a national security matter for US government, then that's the end of conversation. There's no room for US business to continue to influence. But with Trump, it's more like there's basically no principles or not many red lines. If there are more room for US business to influence his policies?

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting. Happy to walk through my thinking, as I often say, I mean, this is great because you guys are in China thinking about what's what the US side is doing. We do obviously, as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to of course, what's happening at the CDF. I mean, my view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that basically that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration, in the first Trump administration, Trump administration officials saying, basically your companies are part of the problem. You helped create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem and so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done. And then that kind of mentality was not said the exact same way, you're part of the problem, but was also kind of maintained throughout the Biden administration for the the reasons that you said, which was the Biden administration just said, well, business community, your concerns are noted, but we are not going to take them really on board because national security trumps them. Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses, a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump on his good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all these other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration generally, and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's good to know. That's good to know, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
You have another question? I was going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually, I mean, understanding that actually helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether the premier Li Qiang's call to foreign business to resist the protectionism or these things going to work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because for multinational companies, they are facing increasing pressure either from their home country government or even from public, right? So because to certain extent, you know, the bring jobs back, bring production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing. And the other thing I want to on the message is the premier wanted to send at CDF is really domestic front. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies, government has the back of the economy. I think we already saw that during two sessions in March when the government announced very aggressive or expensive fiscal policies. I think we talked about that in previous podcasts. I think the other key message the premier really trying to bring home at the CDF is that everyone knows things can get worse later this year if say Trump very dramatically increased tariffs on China, right? And things can go bad very quickly. So one key message that Li Qiang's trying to send is that we also, the policy makers also thought about that and we already have a plan. And this time we'll be better prepared. And before that even happens, we will release additional policies, i.e., policies not included at the two sessions policy package. So they're trying to set that message loud and clear just to assure, if you are worried about the China's economy, we have a plan to deal with that. So don't worry about that.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, so they're trying to say basically like we're willing to stimulate more. We've got a bunch of tools in the toolkit. We've got a lot of dry powder. And, oh, by the way, we understand that the economy is not in the best shape and we're sort of going to accelerate our policy support.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, if we look at just all the Chambers of Commerce survey, foreign Chambers of Commerce survey, last year, they're basically across Chamber of Commerce, the top two issues for multinational companies is the economy and this geopolitical tension. And I think this especially last year, the top concern is actually the economy, China's economy. And the second one is geopolitical tension. I think that the order switched over this year when Trump came to power. I think for most multinational companies, geopolitical top one concern, but economy, I think is still one of the second concern. So they're just trying to address those concerns.

Andrew Polk:
Well, and that gets to the next question, Ether, which is, I was in Beijing for the CDF last year. I didn't go to the CDF. I just happened to be in Beijing at that time. And I talked to a ton of senior business executives, some of our clients. And the mood was actually like, despite the economy being pretty bad, the mood was pretty upbeat. So this was spring 2024.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Polk:
I found it pretty noticeable that this was the first time a lot of these executives actually had been to China since the pandemic started, right? So the COVID policy all the way to the end of 2022, then 2023, people were sort of sending lower level executives through, kind of trying to get their feet back into the China market. And then the senior executives for the first time came in spring 2024. And there was a lot of positive energy around these business people finally being back in China. But then throughout the rest of 2024, the economy still struggled. So my question to you is, what is your sense around the CDF of what the mood is among businesses, both domestic and foreign? You've touched on it a little bit, but, and then the second thing is, sure, the Chinese government is saying, like, we've got the economy's back. We know the issues. But does anybody believe it? You know what I mean? Surely, where are businesses heads at?

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I think in terms of kind of like the business vibes, I think for Chinese business, and even I sense that among the public a little bit is actually right after Chinese New Year, the sentiment getting to start to improve or getting warmed up. I think

Andrew Polk:
That's just Chinese New Year 2025, so February 25.

Ether Yin:
Yes. Yes. Okay. And I think the biggest thing happened there is actually over the Chinese New Year if you all remember, the Deep Seek overnight become a headline globally, right? Kind of tanked the US stock market, even temporarily, but still, basically made headlines all over the world. I think what that does to the both public sentiment and business sentiment. I mean, Chinese business sentiment in particular is that basically over the past few years, you're under this kind of narrative or sense that we, by we, I mean, China's economy or Chinese industry is being suppressed by the US, either both government, sanctions and also US business. But just because of Deep Seek, everyone feels like we made a breakthrough. We can argue that if that's true or not and to what extent that's true, but still, that gave the people a boost of confidence that we can do this. We can, the industry, the economy can make a breakthrough in that containment or suppression, whatever. And then you got all the business, manufacturing, everyone want to figure out in their business, how they can integrate into this AI thing. And I think visibly in premier's government work report during two sessions, I think they didn't say that, but we can see some signs that because of Deep Seek, they even changed some language in the government work report because some of the AI initiative wouldn't be possible without Deep Seek's overnight's success. That's big and huge. And then also that leads to, I think, global investors' revaluation of China's stock market and, the price going up, a lot of folks here has investment in that, that also helps to boost sentiment. And then that lead to March two sessions, I would say nothing is unexpected from the economic policies, but it's also not disappointing, which is basically to the public and industry here that, okay, government will keep their promise that the policy, economic policy is going to be very supportive this year. So I think that changed the overall sentiment a lot.

Andrew Polk:
So that's huge. I mean, I want to bring Joe in here because the reason I say that's huge is so I just said I was at, in Beijing around the time of the or during the time of the CDF 2024. So that was the spring. Like I said, among the foreign business community, there was optimism just because it was the first time these executives had been in China and they felt like they were re-engaging the China market. Throughout the course of the rest of 2024 though, the economy really struggled and it over the summer of 2024 and then the fall of 2024. I was in China at, during both of those periods, and it became evident at that point, sentiment among businesses, not just foreign businesses, but domestic businesses, and domestic individuals was, I mean, it's all anybody would talk about. Like, housing market still under wraps. People don't want to spend money, just like, things are not good. And so hearing that you're saying you think just in the past few months, that's really starting to turn a corner is interesting. Joe, you've lived in China for what, I mean, 10 years now. Have you seen a change in sentiment as well, just among kind of yourself as a consumer in China, your network of both Chinese and foreign individuals living here, just living life. What's your read on that all that?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, I think it's kind of an interesting question in terms of whether or not me being on the ground, I mean, I feel like in some ways the fact that you can kind of come here with between a gap of several months, you can in some ways are better positioned to say like, oh, this is different from the last time I was here, whereas I mean, it's a little bit like a frog in a boiling pot as you kind of don't realize the change until all of a sudden you do. Having said that, yeah, I mean, I tend to agree with Ether, just on the anecdotal level, yeah, last year it was my my friends in Beijing, it was kind of doom and gloom. You know, we had young Chinese people, you were saying to me, well, my my parents kind of pressured me into buying a house, but now it's underwater in terms of price and I kind of feel like I regret it. I hear less of that now. I think other small indicators, I see kind of fewer closed storefronts, which I think is sort of been a fairly noticeable thing in the aftermath of COVID is a lot of closed storefronts. People seem to be getting out a lot as well and I'm worried that there might be a conflating variable there and that the weather's doing to get nice and maybe that's why people are coming out. In general, yeah, and I mean, I think that there have been a number of I think developments in the news that have also made people feel maybe somewhat better. So Ether already talked about DeepSeek. But I also think events in the US by comparison, people in China may be feel like they're not so not so bad off. So I mean, they're certainly reading the news about the economic hardship that a lot of Americans are facing. But even something like the Xiao Hong Shu phenomenon where it was the first time in possibly ever where you had a lot of young Chinese and Americans kind of interacting with each other on on a large scale. I think, you know, whether or not, you know, they gained a fully accurate picture of one another, I think the narrative that emerged from that was for Chinese people was like, oh, wow, it's really not so bad living in China and there's a lot of aspects of how about the US which are, you know, quite troubling. Again, I mean, we can we can debate whether or not that's a fair takeaway from all of that, especially given kind of the different ways that the information ecosystems are are curated in the two countries. But I really feel like all these contributing factors are things that are making people say, well, things are not great, but they could be worse, right? I mean, I I also have a lot of friends who are taking advantage of the consumer trade-in program. And so, yeah, I mean, I I wouldn't say it's like a a massive night and day shift, but it's certainly just as as a sense check in terms of the overall vibe as as an economic indicator, it does seem somewhat better than it's been in the past year or so.

Ether Yin:
Yeah, totally. I mean, Joe made a great point. I think the other aspect here or contributing factor here is that actually the Chinese are kind of over-prepared for the Trump administration. What I mean is like everyone expecting the second term will be very hard at the beginning. As of now, it's still, you know, not great, but still kind of like, you know, better than expected. And also, on top of that, there's this feeling that over the past few years, it's US against China because seems like the US government is very focused on picking on China. But now it's like, it's US against the world, you know, everyone suffers. It's not just us. That also kind of helps you improve how you feel a little bit. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, I mean, that's really interesting because just as you guys were talking, both of you, I was thinking about how, I mean, for several years now, we've really talked about, you know, kind of the lack of consumer confidence, the weak business.
