Andrew Polk:
Hi everybody and welcome to the latest Trivium China podcast, a proud member of the Seneca Podcast Network. I'm your host Trivium China co-founder Andrew Polk, coming to you today from Shanghai, and I am really glad to be joined by two new guests from Trivium China, also both joining us from Shanghai today. So we'll start with another one of my Trivium China co-founders, Ether Yin. Ether, great to have you on the podcast for the first time. How are you doing, man?

Ether Yin:
Doing great. Thank you, Andrew. I feel excited about joining our podcast for the first time.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, it's great to have you on. We're going to have a good discussion. And then we're also glad to have our head of geopolitical research, who's usually based in Beijing, but also in Shanghai today. That's Joe Mazur. Joe, great to have you on. How are you doing?

Joe Mazur:
Thanks, I'm doing good, Andrew. A long time listener, first time caller.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah. Love it. Love it. Well, it's great to have both of you guys on, not only because I don't get to see you guys very much and we're all in the same place, which is awesome, but also because we're going to discuss what was the biggest development out of China this week, which was the holding of the annual China Development Forum, or CDF, which is where a bunch of foreign executives come to Beijing and get the chance to talk with senior Chinese leaders. And Joe, being our lead geopolitical analyst, and Ether being our, well, overall policy guru, but also very deep into our research on the overall business environment in China, you're the perfect guests to have for this discussion. So what we're going to talk about today is the CDF, as I said, which is a big yearly confab where Chinese leaders get together with foreign business leaders. So we'll get into the key developments that took place at the CDF and the overall tone of the gathering from the past few days. We'll also discuss the wider thinking of the business community in China, as well as how consumers are feeling against this backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions. And then thirdly, the last thing we'll touch on is the latest development on the economic coercion front, which was Monday's release of new regulations to beef up China's anti-foreign sanctions law. So lots to cover, but before we do that, we have to start with the customary vibe check. And I feel like it's particularly important this week because I find that often the vibes, especially around US-China or around China, are different when you're talking about China from the outside and when you're on the ground here in Shanghai or Beijing or wherever. So Joe, let me start with you. What's your vibe as we kick off this podcast here in the last week of March?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, the vibes are good. On a personal level, being here in Shanghai, seeing some colleagues whom I don't often get to see. The weather's very nice. But also, on the work front, it may be hectic, but it's certainly never boring. So the vibes, I will call stimulating.

Andrew Polk:
That's a very positive spin. A lot of people, we keep hearing the word overwhelming. Kendra on the pod the other day said, I forget exactly what she said, but basically that we're at turbo speed or something like that. So you're very much in line with everybody else. So, let me throw it over to Ether then. Ether, how is your vibe in life in regard to the China business environment, whether that's domestic Chinese companies, foreign MNCs doing business in China? How are you feeling?

Ether Yin:
Well, I think, first of all, life is great. Almost half my life is work, which is this company. I think we're doing great. Also, having you guys coming to Shanghai makes me feel super, super happy. So it's great, nothing to complain. Regarding the general vibe in the China business environment, I think that's interesting because I'm pretty sure we'll get into that more later. But overall, I think, if we're talking about Chinese private business, I think the vibe there is actually going up, especially compared to last year. We can talk about why that is, what happened, later. But I think if we're talking about foreign business, it's probably on a different track. I think there are some improvements for them, probably on the domestic front, but also, I think in general, the external challenges they are facing now are getting multiplied over the past few months. That's bad for them. I think on a net, I don't know where that puts them. I think in general, compared to Chinese private business, they are a bit more pessimistic and facing more challenges.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, yeah, well, we'll get into why that is. Why domestic private businesses may be feeling better and as you say, why foreign multinationals in China sort of have ups and downs, but that's a good point. On my vibe, I feel the same as you in terms of I was on the podcast yesterday. I told everybody I was coming here to Shanghai and I'm now in Shanghai, seeing the team. We've got our folks from Beijing down. So that's amazing. Just for a little bit of showing people behind the curtain on how Trivium works. We're a small company, but we basically, we have multinational problems is kind of what I say, small company with multinational problems. We very rarely get to be face-to-face with our colleagues and so it's been really great to have the Beijing team down and be here with everybody who's based in China. So really loving that. So thanks for the vibe checks, guys. Good to kick things off with that. Let me, before we get into the media discussion, go through a couple quick housekeeping notes as usual.

So, all right, with that, fellas, let's get into the China Development Forum. It's happened over the past couple of days. So we're recording on Wednesday the 26th of March. It was Monday, Tuesday, the 23rd, 24th. We'll talk a little bit about what the forum is exactly. So, it's been held annually since the year 2000. The CDF is China's top forum for connecting foreign executives directly with senior Chinese officials to discuss trade and investment. This year, top executives from 86 multinational companies attended the forum. That's a slight decline from 2024. And US companies topped the list, sending 27 senior executives. One of the highlights of this meeting is typically first a speech from the premier, talking about the economy. He's usually talking up the economy, how great it is, how welcome foreign businesses are. And that was again the case this year. We'll get into a little bit of what Li Qiang, the premier talked about. But also the premier usually meets with foreign business leaders. And that happened this year, which was notable because last year, they canceled the one-on-one or small group meeting with the premier and senior business leaders, which was pretty disappointing for folks who had come all the way from their home countries to the meeting with the premier. The meeting with the premier is usually the highlight for these executives. But yeah, kind of giving that background, oh, go ahead, Ether. Go ahead.

Ether Yin:
No, I just want to point out. I think if you look at the premier's meetings with businesses, it's still, I could argue for some foreign businesses, still disappointing because now the whole setting is primarily focused on US business. And I think the meeting, the US delegation is led by the Republican Senator. So, you can still argue that the meeting is not inclusive enough to address the whole foreign business community.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, that's a good point. And the geopolitics obviously in the US-China specifically relationship hang over everything. It's interesting. You did mention Steve Daines, who's, Joe, is he from your home state, Montana? Is that right?

Joe Mazur:
He's from the great state of Montana.

Andrew Polk:
All right. Well, so he's here along with the delegation trying to potentially lay the groundwork for a meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump later in the year, which we'll get into that as well. But your point, Ether, is that it was actually similar to last year in that Xi Jinping met with only US businesses last year. And we'll get into this as well, so I don't want to jump too far ahead, but it kind of underscores the point that geopolitics hang heavy over everything, and it's all about the US business community, leaving the European and Asian communities wondering how they fit in. But let's stop there for a sec and I want to throw it over to Joe. Joe, what was the message that you really got from Li Qiang, from his or the senior Chinese government officials, what message are they trying to send to foreign business leaders at the moment? And, give us any other color from the CDF that you think we're missing here.

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, well, so I think it's probably just worth saying that if it's not obvious, the CDF is a great chance for foreign CEOs to do a number of things. First of all, they get a chance to interface directly with high-level Chinese officials, which is a fairly rare opportunity in most cases. It's also a chance for them to get a sense check of how things are on the ground and to discuss with their fellow titans of industry, how they feel about the China market. So, for all those reasons, it's an event not to be missed and really has drawn a pretty wide selection of CEOs in different industries from high-profile companies. It's also a chance to show that, you know, we're in China for China and they express their commitment to the China market, because that's also quite important. But in terms of the messaging that's come out of the CDF, I think that in a lot of respects, it's pretty standard. And if you follow these sort of meetings, you'll be familiar with a lot of these talking points. So things like China remains committed to opening, we welcome foreign companies to participate in China's development. We're going to continue to relax restrictions to treat foreign companies equally with Chinese companies. And so these are all fairly standard talking points from events like this and Chinese messaging towards the foreign business community in general. There's also a piece which I think is quite interesting and we've seen more of in recent years, which is the overtures the Chinese side is making to foreign companies to play an important role in resisting protectionism and unilateralism. So the hope that these companies as beneficiaries of China's opening, as beneficiaries of globalization, will then maybe exert some kind of influence on their home governments to say, hey, we understand you have these concerns about trade deficits, about security, but really we think that the trade relationship between our country and China is important, it's worth preserving and it's worth expanding. So that's another note that the Chinese side has hit on pretty frequently in recent years and was again reiterated here at the CDF.

Andrew Polk:
Yeah, you hit the points well. I guess one follow-up question, the Chinese have been trying to work with the business community to influence US government decisions for decades, right? And that used to work. Is it still working or is business heard from your perspective in, I mean, other capitals as well, but DC and Brussels in particular? Or are the Chinese barking up the wrong tree, or is it still just worth them doing it even if the business community doesn't have a stronger voice among politicians? What are your thoughts there?

Joe Mazur:
Yeah, it's a brave new world, especially in the context of the US and the Trump administration. I think it doesn't hurt for them to try to make this overture. I think it's certainly worth them saying, hey, think about it. You've gained a lot of opportunities from the China market and there are still more to come. So it behooves you to try to stabilize the trade relationship. And I do think to some extent, yes, certainly in the past, companies and trade bodies have played a role in influencing the trajectory of US-China policy and China's relationship with other countries. So now I think, we talk about US-China versus EU-China, those are two different things. I think that what we've seen in the case of the EU is that this sort of business pressure does work, both positive and negative. In the lead-up to the EU's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs back in, I think it was November, there was a lot of politicking happening and China was exerting pressure, both in terms of inducements and threats, to kind of win over votes to their side on that. And ultimately, those tariffs did go through, but I think that it shows that there is a degree of efficacy to this sort of wheeling and dealing. For the US side, I think that really remains to be seen. My immediate reaction is that I don't think the Trump administration necessarily cares what happens to any individual US company in the China market. I think they're so laser-focused on the trade deficit and this America first economic policy, which we'll probably get more of a hint of April 2nd. But I mean, it certainly doesn't hurt to try. And who knows? Maybe if you have a high-profile enough CEO, like Tim Cook, lobbying the Trump administration, not on behalf of China, but with aligned goals with China, then maybe there's something to be said for that and maybe that would be enough to get the US to at least consider what its policy means for US companies in China.

Ether Yin:
That's a very interesting question. I actually want to ask you guys, particularly Andrew, because most of the time you're based in DC, so you are very familiar with the atmosphere there and how things are in DC. My question is generally, do you think that compared to Trump and Biden, under the Trump administration, there's more room for US business to influence the policy a little bit? My assumption would be my understanding with Biden is that his administration operated on certain principles and red lines. Basically, when US businesses have conversations trying to influence certain policies, and when it reaches, "Okay, this is a national security matter for the US government," then that's the end of the conversation. There's no room for US business to continue to influence. But with Trump, it's more like there are basically no principles or not many red lines. Is there more room for US business to influence his policies?

Andrew Polk:
Well, it's interesting; I'm happy to walk through my thinking. As I often say, this is great because you guys are in China, thinking about what the US side is doing. We do obviously, as I say to our listeners, always try to be thinking about what's happening in China. But this is a great point and it's pertinent to what's happening at the CDF. My view would be that basically the business community's influence on policy was reduced dramatically in the first Trump administration. And that's when you started hearing, especially vis-a-vis China, Trump administration officials saying, basically, your companies are part of the problem. You helped create this issue of driving a trade surplus from China by outsourcing a lot of production there. And you're part of the problem, so we're not going to listen to your voice. We're trying to undo the things that you have done. And then that mentality was not said the exact same way—"you're part of the problem"—but was also maintained throughout the Biden administration for the reasons you said. The Biden administration essentially told the business community, "Your concerns are noted, but we're not going to take them on board because national security trumps them." Now, in the second Trump administration, I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but what we definitely see is a lot of global businesses or a lot of US businesses trying to get on Trump's good side, right? They're dropping their DEI policies, they're doing all this other stuff. The tech companies are showing up at the inauguration and helping to, donating to the inauguration. So I think there is space for the business community to have more of a say in this second Trump administration generally and potentially when it comes to China. And basically companies have had four years to plan for how they might try to influence or work with a second Trump administration. So everyone's a little bit more prepared than they were.

Ether Yin:
Right. Yeah, yeah. That's good to know. That's good to know. Yeah.

Andrew Polk:
Do you have another question? I was going to throw one back at you.

Ether Yin:
No, I was just going to say that's actually, understanding that actually helps reinforce our understanding about just basically whether Premier Li Qiang's call for foreign business to resist protectionism, all these things, is going to work. I think it won't. I think that's the bottom line. Just because for multinational companies, they're facing increasing pressure either from their home country government or even from the public, right? To a certain extent, bringing jobs and production back to the country is what the public wants as well. So that's one thing. And the other thing I want to note on the message the premier wanted to send at CDF is really the domestic front. It's basically trying to assure foreign companies the government supports the economy. I think we already saw that during the
